      <p>Yes. The general style followed by most of <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i>,

      <p>Our glaring inconsistency, we don't require parens around the collection

      <p>What's cool about this convention is that it enables a human reader to 
        perform scope analysis on the pre-expansion text by following a few simple 
        rules. Why is this important?</p>
      <h1 align="center"> The Power of Irrelevance:</h1>
      <h2 align="center"> On the design of notation to support the review process</h2>
      <p> One the lessons driven home by our Xanadu experience: Any data structure 
        used to answer queries from a huge amount of data must first of all provide 
        the property of quick reject: it must quickly disqualify most of the data 
        it holds from being relevant to the query, so that it can afford to do 
        more subtle calculations on what remains. A good example might be rectangular 
        bounding boxes around complex shapes in a graphics app, so that we can 
        quickly reject all shapes that don't almost intersect a ray. We can then 
        do a more subtle calculation on the remaining candidates, to see if they 
        do intersect.</p>
      <p>In thinking about lessons from the <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-review/index.html">security 
        review</a> you and David put us through ;), I came to realize that much 
        of its success was due to <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i>'s 
        support for a similar quick reject property. Given a question and a large 
        body of largely unfamiliar code, the first job of a programming language 
        notation is to help human readers (both with and without IDE help) do 
        a quick reject: to disqualify most of the program as being irrelevant 
        to the current question without needing to look at most of it. (See also 
        <a href="http://www.visibleworkings.com/">Visible Workings</a>.)</p>
      <p>Scope analysis is the reader's main tool for quickly determining, when 
        looking at a program fragment, which things cannot influence what other 
        things. Scope analysis gives a first conservative bound on possible influence 
        analysis.</p>
      <p>This explanation helps explains what's wrong with Smalltalk-72, all macro 
        systems I know about <a href="#foot1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#foot2"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
        dynamic scoping, ambient authority, Pascal's <tt>var</tt> and C++'s references. 
        When looking at a call site (or something that locally looks like it is 
        a call site), can the reader tell, without knowledge of the thing apparently 
        being called, what things of the caller are being made accessible to the 
        callee. All the above language elements disrupt that analysis. For example, 
        in <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> or C-without-macros, in 
        the call</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><tt>foo(x)</tt> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>without knowing foo, we still know that the callee is being given access 
        to x's value, but isn't given the ability to assign to the x variable. 
        If the <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> or C-without-macro 
        programmer wishes to give foo the ability to change x's value, they need 
        to write</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><tt> foo(&amp;x)</tt> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>which makes this extra access visible to readers that don't know foo. 
        Pascal and C++ don't have this property. Unless you know how foo declares 
        the corresponding parameter, you can't tell what the caller has given 
        the callee the ability to do. These tend towards the failure mode of which 
        Smalltalk-72 was the extreme: you can't understand anything about the 
        program until you understand everything.</p>
      <p>In Smalltalk-76, Smalltalk-80, Squeak, ML, Kernel-E, or Scheme-without-macros, 
        the program is written in a simple language with very few scoping rules, 
        where those rules reliably allow the reader, from a program fragment, 
        to use scope analysis to disqualify much of the program from relevance 
        to a question, without looking up the definition of things mentioned at 
        call sites. This property is essential for secure code, but is also important 
        in general.</p>
      <p>Clearly, all macro systems prior to Scheme's invention of the notion 
        of hygienic macros (who invented this notion?) fatally disrupt this ability. 
        Scope analysis was only done after macro expansion, so the reader would 
        have to simulate the expansion in their head before that could use scope 
        analysis. This requires understanding which calls are actually macro calls, 
        and it requires looking up the definition of all those macros and understanding 
        them.</p>
      <p>What about hygienic macros themselves? This has pointed the way towards 
        sense, but doesn't go far enough to achieve the above goal. The reader 
        of a fragment of a Scheme program that might be using hygienic macros 
        must still do everything listed above before scope analysis allows them 
        to disqualify any of the program from relevance to their question.</p>
      <p>In the absence of macro expansion, we can think of the normal analysis 
        of code as proceeding by the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Reading sequences of bits to recognize characters. (With UTF-8, 
          this step isn't as trivial as it once was.) 
        <li>2. Lexing: Reading sequences of characters to recognize tokens. 
        <li>3. Parsing: Reading sequences of tokens to recognize BNF productions, 
          producing ASTs. 
        <li>4. Scope Analysis: Walking ASTs to match use and defining occurrences 
          of identifiers, hopefully by simple lexical scoping rules. 
      </ul>
      <p>I believe the above sequence works so well because it has some kind of 
        psychological match to what kinds of recognition tasks humans perform 
        well when looking at program text. I won't try to defend this claim, but 
        I do assume it. From my own introspection it seems right. Yes, I know 
        introspection is a terrible guide, but it's the best I've got.</p>
      <p>In any case, we categorize macro systems according to where they intervene 
        in the above sequence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1.5. Pre-ANSI-C operated on character sequences prior to lexing. 
        <li>2.5. ANSI-C operates on the token stream between lexing and parsing. 
        <li>3.5. Non-hygienic Lisp macro systems operated on the S-Expression 
          (Lisp's AST) between parsing and scope analysis. 
        <li>4. Scheme's hygienic macros operates after parsing, and interleaved 
          with scope analysis. 
      </ul>
      <p>I believe most would agree that each step along this sequence has led 
        to an increase in quality, from a software engineering standpoint. I claim 
        that the reason is that each step has enabled a reader to understand more 
        about a program fragment prior to simulating the expansion of the macros. 
        The E-to-Kernel-E expansion comes close to providing the following property. 
        Where <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> fails to provide the 
        following property, that should be considered a bug to be fixed. Should 
        <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> ever allow user-defined macros, 
        these must preserve the following property as well. The productions reserved 
        for macros in the <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> grammar 
        are indeed able to produce a macro system with this property.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4.5. Expansion happens after scope analysis. Scope analysis therefore 
          happens on the pre-expansion text, without reference to the definition 
          of the macros being invoked. (Of course, it need not be implemented 
          this way, as long as the effect is equivalent.) 
      </ul>
      <p>I claim this would be better by direct extrapolation of the above argument.</p>
      <p>However, we also wish the results of expansion to be a program in the 
        language, so that we may use the same notation to explain the results 
        of expansion. This leads to the following rule:</p>
      <p>Imagine that we printed the expanded program (in our case, the resulting 
        Kernel-E program) as the source text of a program in the source language 
        (in our case, an <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> program). 
        If a scope analysis of the expanded program would yield different bindings 
        than the pre-expansion scope analysis, statically reject the program.</p>
      <p>Here's an example where earlier <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> 
        implementations failed to obey this rule:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">pragma</span>.syntax(&quot;<span class="litchars">0.8</span>&quot;)

<span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">i</span> := 3
<span class="stdout"># value: 3</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(The following test case no longer describes how E actually behaves, 
        and so it is protected by an extra column of &quot;#&quot; so that it 
        won't cause a failing <a href="../elang/tools/updoc.html">updoc</a> test.)</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><span class="stdout">#? </span><span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="defvar">i</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> (0..i) { println(i) }
<span class="stdout">## stdout: 0
##         1
##         2
##         3
##</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Surprised? You should be. By the normal <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> 
        rules, which the <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> reader can 
        rely on almost all the time, an identifier comes into scope starting at 
        its defining occurrence and proceeding left-to-right until the end of 
        its containing scope box, except as shadowed by definitions of the same 
        identifier in contained scope boxes. A scope box starts at the keyword 
        introducing a clause (here, <tt class="keyword">for</tt>), and lasts until 
        the corresponding close curly. <a href="../elang/blocks/ifExpr.html">http://www.erights.org/elang/blocks/ifExpr.html</a></p>
      <p>By this rule, the reader would be justified in expecting the <tt>i</tt> 
        in <tt>(0..i)</tt> to refer to the <tt>i</tt> in <span class="keyword"><tt>for</tt></span><tt> 
        <span class="defvar">i</span> <span class="keyword">in</span></tt>. Because 
        of the expansion of the for-loop, and because the current <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> 
        implementation's scope analysis, like pre-hygienic Lisps, operates only 
        after expansion, and because the for-loop expansion reverses the order 
        in which these two parts occur, as well as placing the iteration variable 
        <tt>i</tt> in a nested scope box, the <tt>i</tt> in <tt>(0..i)</tt> refers 
        to the <span class="keyword"><tt>def</tt></span><tt> <span class="defvar">i</span></tt>, 
        whereas the <tt>i</tt> in <tt>println(i)</tt> refers to the iteration 
        variable <tt class="defvar">i</tt> which shadows the <tt class="defvar">i</tt> 
        in <span class="keyword"><tt>def</tt></span><tt> <span class="defvar">i</span></tt>.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="defvar">i</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> (0..i) { println(i) }
<span class="stderr"># syntax error: Use on right isn't really in scope of definition: [&quot;i&quot;]</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> now does is to statically 
        reject the above program. This new behavior may possibly give the program's 
        author an unpleasant static surprise. But the inability to author this 
        kind of obfuscated program will prevent nasty surprises to the readers, 
        which is vastly more important. Even for programs I author, I read them 
        much more than I author them. Legal programs must fulfill the expectations 
        both of readers who are thinking about the pre-expanded text, and of readers 
        who are simulating the expansion in their head.</p>
      <p>What does this have to do with parens around patterns? At the head of 
        a scope box, ie, the part between the keyword introducing the clause and 
        the open curly, when we see an identifier, in order to do scope analysis 
        by the above rule, we need to be able to tell whether it's a use occurrence 
        or a defining occurrence. In order to determine this, you need to know 
        if it's in an expression, a pattern, or something else. Given that we 
        can ask the reader to memorize a small fixed set of &quot;something else&quot; 
        cases (eg, <tt><span class="defverb">identifier</span>(patterns,...)</tt> 
        after a <tt class="keyword">to</tt>), the only remaining rule is: If it's 
        surrounded with parens, it's an expression. If not, it's a pattern.</p>
      <p>Should we ever allow user-defined macros, they would be constrained to 
        play by this rule, enabling pre-expansion scope analysis to proceed using 
        the left-to-right rule. As with the for-loop, rather than constrain macros 
        only to produce expansions that preserve the scope analysis, we can instead 
        reject just those programs that cause an expansion that would disrupt 
        the pre-expansion scope analysis.</p>
      <p>Other known occurrences of this bug in the current <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> 
        implementation: 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Dean has objected that the current expansions of <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> 
            and <tt>||</tt> can disrupt a pre-expansion scope analysis. I agree. 
            The current expansions of these must be considered buggy on these 
            grounds. Fortunately, an alternate expansion can fix this in all cases, 
            never requiring a surprising static reject of a program.</p>
        <li> 
          <p>In the expansion of, for example, the quasi-pattern <tt>`<span class="litchars">-</span>$i<span class="litchars">-</span>@<span class="defvar">i</span><span class="litchars">-</span>@<span class="defvar">j</span><span class="litchars">-</span>$j<span class="litchars">-</span>`</tt>, 
            the relative order among the embedded dollar-hole expressions is preserved, 
            and the relative order among the at-hole patterns is preserved, but 
            all the extracted expressions occur in the expansion to the left of 
            all the extracted patterns. As one would expect from the pre-expansion 
            text, <tt>$i</tt> refers to the <tt>i</tt> already in scope, not that 
            defined by <tt>@<span class="defvar">i</span></tt>. But <tt>$j</tt> 
            also refers to the <tt>j</tt> already in scope, not the <tt>j</tt> 
            defined by <tt>@<span class="defvar">j</span></tt>. This violates 
            the left-to-right rule. <i><font color="#009000"><b>E</b></font></i> 
            must instead statically reject the program, rather than allow a reader 
            to be confused about the meaning of <tt>$j</tt>.</p>
