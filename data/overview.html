      <h1>Our Six Layer Model of Representations </h1>
      <p>We present here a six layer conceptual framework for handling symbolic
        data of various kinds, including XML, object serialization, programming
        language text, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s own Term-tree
        system, and more. As with the ISO seven layer protocol model, we propose
        this model as a way to organize the issues, as shown in the table below,
        in which the representations range from more concrete ones at the bottom
        to more abstract ones at the top. Each individual data representation
        system, like XML, will be shown as its own tower. Where possible, these
        towers will be a subset of the model tower shown below. We will also explain
        those ways in which a particular representation system does not fit this
        model. Some representational systems, like relational databases, are so
        far outside the model that it's not useful to try to shoehorn them in.</p>

      <p>Within each tower, the representation box at each layer stands for the
        set of all possible things which can be said in the &quot;language&quot;
        of that representation. For example, the 'char sequences' box in a given
        layer might represent the set of all possible sequences of Unicode characters.
        Any particular sequence of Unicode characters would be a member of this
        set, or a &quot;sentence&quot; of this &quot;language&quot;.</p>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <h3><img src="images/transforms.gif" width="373" height="189" align="right">A
        Taxonomy of Transformations</h3>
      <p>A transformation is a mapping from instances in one representation to
        instances of another representation. Those transformations that map from
        lower level to higher level representations with a given tower are <i>abstractors</i>,
        shown on the left in the above table. The transformations in the opposite
        direction are <i>renderers</i>, shown on the right in the table.</p>
      <p>Not shown in the above table are the transformations that operate within
        a level. We distinguish two kinds. Transformations within a level within
        one tower are <i>operators</i>. They map from members of a set to members
        of the same set, so that one may speak about repeated application, closure
        properties, and such. Transformations within a level but between towers
        are <i>translators</i>. They map a sentence said in one language into
        a corresponding sentence of another language, where these two languages
        are at a similar conceptual level.</p>
      <p>Actual transformations can often be described as compositions of these
        transformational steps. For example, the front-end of a compiler can be
        described (approximately) as the composition of a tower of abstractors,
        reading UTF8 octets into Unicode characters, lexing these into tokens,
        parsing these into an abstract syntax tree, and resolving scopes and types
        into a graph representation of the program. Here the upward source-oriented-representation
        tower stops. The backend of a compiler can be described as the composition
        of renderers in a separate tower, rendering a flow graph into a sequence
        of symbolic instructions, which could be rendered into an assembly language,
        to be assembled into a linkable binary file. </p>
      <p>The compiler as a whole is the composition of the the source-oriented
        tower of abstractors, the translator from the source-oriented-graph to
        the computation-oriented-graph, and the computation-oriented tower of
        renderers. Note that even in our idealized story, some levels were skipped:
        the compiler backend rendered the flow graph into an instruction sequence
        in one step, without going through a tree representation. Actual compilers
        also skip the assembly language step, going from symbolic instructions
        to binary instructions in one step. Sometimes it will be useful to describe
        such jumps as a composition of smaller steps, and sometimes it won't.</p>

        Towers and Spoke Towers</h3>
      <p>x</p>
      <h3>Abstracting Steps</h3>
      <p>The <i>abstracting</i> steps on the left are relations providing upwards
        transformations, in which data represented at a lower layer is mapped
        into a representation at a higher layer. When the specification on an
        abstracting step is deterministic, it forms a function -- a relation in
        which each acceptable input is mapped to exactly one output. (Note that
        one can have a deterministic implementation of a non-deterministic specification,
        but it is the determinism of the specification that matters.) Those lower
        layer representations that are acceptable as inputs to a given abstracting
        step are <i>well formed</i> with respect to that abstracting step. The
        set of well-formed inputs are the <i>domain</i> of the abstraction step.
        For example, in a tower whose abstracting steps form a C parser, only
        those character sequences that form a proper C token would be well formed
        input to a C lexer.</p>
      <p>The set higher-layer representations that an abstracting step may produce
        are the <i>range</i> of the abstracting step. If a given abstracting step
        may produce any possible representations at a higher level, (if its range
        is the entire target representation), and if its specification is deterministic,
        then it is <i>universal</i> with respect to that higher layer representation.
        The domain of a universal abstracting step forms a language for writing
        such higher level representations in the lower layer notation -- any higher
        layer representation is representable at the lower layer. For example,
        if we define a C language tower's symbol-tree layer as a C specific AST,
        such that any possible AST configuration correponds to a valid C program,
        and if all valid C programs can be written, then (ignoring implementation
        limits like finite memory) a C parser would be universal within that tower.</p>
      <p>If a given abstracting step maps only to a subset of the higher level
        representation, then exactly those higher level representations within
        this subset are <i>valid</i> with respect to that abstracting step, and
        we have a <i>validating</i> abstracting step. From an abstracting step
        one can derive a <i>validity checker</i> that checks whether a given higher
        level representation is within the range of the abstraction step. For
        example, if we instead define the symbol-tree layer of our C tower in
        terms of a more generic AST representation scheme, such as S-Expressions,
        then only those S-Expressions that a C parser may produce are <i>valid</i>
        -- only these are abstractions of syntactically correct C program source.</p>
      <p>Of course, these transformations compose. For the composition of a C
        lexer and parser, the well formed character sequences are those that can
        be lexed into proper tokens, and in which that token stream is itself
        well formed with respect to the parser, ie, can be parsed according to
        the language's grammar. Only these character sequences are in the domain
        of the composite relation.</p>
      <h3>Concretizing Steps</h3>
      <p>The <i>concretizing</i> steps on the right are the inverses of the abstracting
        steps. The inverse of a universal abstracting step is a <i>total </i>concretizing
        step, and is able to concretize any possible instance of the given higher
        level representation. When a concretizing step's specification is deterministic,
        we say it is a <i>canonicalizing function</i>, and that each of its possible
        outputs is <i>canonical</i>. For example, a deterministic C parser would
        generally map C programs which differed only in their whitespace to the
        same AST. A C pretty printer would then print that one AST in some one
        way. By parsing and pretty printing C programs, we have abstracted away
        from their whitespace differences, and made two programs that were otherwise
        identical map to the identical output.</p>
