      <p>To deal with mutual suspicion, secure systems design the interfaces between
        objects (processes, subjects, protection domains) to require <i>least
        authority </i> <i></i> -- authority not unreasonably greater than each
        object needs to carry out its proper duties [ref POLA/POLP, SaltzerShroeder].
        Very few objects possess god-like authority. Most objects operate with
        little authority, and so can do little damage. To provide support for
        an actual diversity of policies, each policy must itself require only
        least authority. The more authority a policy choice would demand, the
        fewer the objects with adequate authority to put that policy into operation.</p>

      <p>To our knowledge, prior to this work, persistence for secure systems,

      <p>However, some of these uses of serialization have been thought to require
        special privilege, limiting their application within object-capability
        systems. We present a serialization framework constrained by <i>POLA</i>
        -- the Principle of Least Authority. As a framework more closely approximates
        <i>least authority</i> in the authority it requies the participants to
        grant each other, it lowers the risks of each to the others. This increases
        the frequency of cases where all the needed parties are willing to bear
        the remaining risks, as well as the cases where the interested parties
        actually have the authority needed to wield the tools, and so increases
        the applicability of serialization as a useful tool.</p>

      <p>Abstract<br>
        Serialization and object-capability security [ref Ode, Demolished] are
        two extensions of the object paradigm that seem to pull in opposing directions.
        This paper presents serialization abstractions for use in object-capability
        systems, which </p>
      <p>Resolve the conflict: They live within object-capability constraints,
        and so maintain object-capability security.</p>
      <p>Leverage the combination: They apply the power of serialization to the
        manipulation of authority and secure identity in addition to information.</p>
      <p>Serialization is used for several purposes in E, a pure object-capability-based
        distributed persistent secure programming language. This paper presents
        E's use of serialization for unprivileged persistence as a motivating
        example for the mechanisms presented here; but most of these ideas are
        applicable to any object-capability language and are useful for many other
        purposes.</p>
      <p></p>
      <hr>
      <p>We often use serialization tools to <i>maintain the fiction of object
        continuity </i>by<i> adapting to a change of context</i>. With these fictions,
        we effectively stretch our object systems across space, time, versions,
        and more. For example, serialization in RMI and CORBA creates a fiction
        that the message as unserialized and delivered in one addess space designates
        the same arguments as the message that was sent from another address space
        -- they adapt to the change of location. Serialization is used for persistence
        by creating the fiction that an object revived from recorded state is
        the same object as the original, well after the original's process has
        died. With long object lifetimes, we need to <i>upgrade</i> -- to adapt
        an old object's state to a new versions of its behavior (class, schema),
        perhaps on an altered platform, all while seeming to be the same object.
        In all these cases, the fiction need not pretend that nothing has changed,
        but rather that the graph of relationships maintained it connectivity,
        and that enough of the original's essential properties were preserved
        so that the adapted objects can &quot;continue&quot; to work in their
        new context.</p>
      <p>No single serialization tool can fulfill all these needs -- there are
        too many kinds of adaptation problems, and too many policy choices that
        must be made for each. Such situations demand <i>mechanism / policy separation</i>
        -- rather than a single built-in one-size-fits-all tool, we need a kit
        of building blocks from which a range of tools may be fashioned, expressing
        a diversiy of policy choices, all potentially co-existing within the same
        system.</p>
      <p>A key security design rule is <i>POLA</i> -- the Principle of Least Authority
        (also known as the Principle of Least Privilege [ref SaltzerShroeder]):
        An entity's interface should require us to give it only that authority
        needed for it to carry out its proper duties -- as with the Valet key
        that does not open the trunk. True <i>least authority</i> is rarely achieved
        or needed. Rather, this is an ideal to be approaced. The less authority
        is granted, the more limited our risk from its misbehavior, and the lower
        the trust required for us to be willing to bear that risk. As our abstraction
        designs </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Depending on our relationship to it, these are risks we are or aren't
        willing to bear. (If we aren't willing to grant it its proper least authority,
        then we cannot make use of it.)</p>
      <p>However, the utility of </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>These shifts of space and time are only two of the kinds of context change
        we may want to transcend. For example, w</p>
      <p>Serialization is being used to stretch object-capability systems over
        many of the same shifts in context, </p>
      <p>POLA-constrained. Diversity of policies.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>To deal with mutual suspicion, secure systems design the interfaces between
        objects (processes, subjects, protection domains) to require <i>least
        authority </i> <i></i> -- authority not unreasonably greater than each
        object needs to carry out its proper duties [ref POLA/POLP, SaltzerShroeder].
        Very few objects possess god-like authority. Most objects operate with
        little authority, and so can do little damage. To provide support for
        an actual diversity of policies, each policy must itself require only
        least authority. The more authority a policy choice would demand, the
        fewer the objects with adequate authority to put that policy into operation.</p>
      <p>Serialization is used for several purposes in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        a pure object-capability-based distributed persistent secure programming
        language. <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> serializes remote
        messages to transcend space -- maintaining the fiction of a single distributed
        heap of mutually suspicious objects, connected by capabilities, and hosted
        by a network of mutually suspicious machines. Capability designers long
        ago realized how to instantiate such a messaging service using hardly
        any initial authority at all [ref Donnelley76, Sansom86/88, Actors?],
        thereby allowing multiple such systems to co-exist. We explain a generalization
        of their invention.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, prior to this work, persistence for secure systems,
        whether by page-fault handling or by serialization, has only been provided
        by services that were granted god-like authority over the subsystem they
        were persisting. As a result, such persistence was provided as a single
        comprehensive one-size-fits-all solution. We explain how <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s
        serialization allows co-existence of unprivileged persistence systems,
        and deals with issues of mutual suspicion</p>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Within the context of secure mutual suspicion, practical support of such
        diversity entails that each such policy choice can be expressed without
        requiring undue authority.</p>
      <p>Some object-capability systems also stretch across these context boundaries
        to create distributed persistent capabilities, and some have used serialization
        for this purpose. In the process, they invented serialization constrained
        by <i>POLA</i> -- the Principle of Least Authority. By generalizing from
        these inventions and applying POLA consistently to various remaining issues,
        this paper presents serialization abstractions for use in object-capability
        systems, which </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>resolve the conflict: They live within object-capability and POLA
            constraints, and so maintain object-capability security, where a simple
            set of mechanisms to may be used to support a greater diversity of
            unprivileged and co-existing policies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>leverage the combination: They apply the power of serialization to
            the manipulation of authority and secure identity in addition to information.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a motivating example for the abstractions presented here, this paper
        presents <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s use of serialization
        for handling<i> object-faults</i> in order to implement <i>unprivileged</i>
        persistence of distributed secure objects. This one example motivates
        all the mechanisms presented in this paper, but most of these abstractions
        should be applicable in any object-capability system and useful for many
        other purposes.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The term <i>object-fault</i> was coined by analogy with <i>page fault</i>
        [ref Loom]. In both cases, state which is conceptually part of a running
        process may actually be stored elsewhere until needed. When part of this
        state is accessed, the state is <i>faulted-in</i> -- converted from its
        external representation into operational form so the attempted access
        can proceed. To the process performing this access, this faulting is not
        visible. Typically, virtual memory mechanisms are used only to increase
        the storage available to a graph of processes, but they can also be used
        for <i>persistence</i> -- to extends the lifetime of a graph of processes
        well beyond the crash or replacement of their hosting machine [ref KeyKOS,
        EROS, Grasshopper]. </p>
      <p>Typically, such fault handlers are included in the system's primitives,
        and so operate with privileges significantly greater than that granted
        to ordinary processes. Though some operating systems allow unprivileged
        fault handlers [ref KeyKOS Segment Keeper, Mach], in order to make available
        to ordinary programs the power inherent in the fault mechanism -- to be
        able to engage in arbitrary computation on the way to servicing a fault
        -- and so enable this mechanism to be used for semantically significant
        purposes; like copy-on-write, encrypted disks, data breakpoints, generational
        GC write barriers, etc... However, unprivileged <i>page fault </i>handlers
        operate on pages, which are already only data, and typically operate only
        within the scope of a single protection domain -- each serves the needs
        of just one process, which is assumed to represent only a single interest.</p>
      <p>There has been much work on object persistence, much of which also attempts
        to provide object-oriented virtual memory as part of the deal. Some, such
        as PJama [ref PJama] </p>

      Once upon a time, the object Carol is invoked and receives a <tt>3</tt>
      from an incoming message. How does she know what it means? How does she
      know if it's correct, what she's supposed to do with it, or if it's safe
      for her to believe it? She can validate incoming arguments with type declarations
      or assertions, but this may tell her only that this is indeed an integer,
      as she may already know to expect of that argument. Further refinements,
      like subranges, units, or so called &quot;self-describing data&quot; --
      that it is 3 oranges raher than 3 seconds -- may help catch some common
      accidents, and may be adequate for Carol to preserve her own internal integrity,
      but none of these really answer the questions posed above.
      <p>By the experience of programming, we already know in our bones why these
        quandries are not actually problems for Carol. Any attempt to state these
        reasons may seem to belabor the obvious, but are necessary to extend this
        reasonng to less obvious situations. A bit sequence has little meaning
        when considered devoid of context. We must understand the how the computational
        context of an object gives each incoming argument adequate meaning --

      <p>Java's Object Serialization Streams (JOSS) [ref JOSS] is an good example
        of the opposite notion -- of serialization as a framework for customizing,
        and for composing customizations, of the processes of depiction and reconstruction.</p>
      <p>In many object serialization systems including JOSS, there's enough flexibility
        that a serializer can compute just about any function from a subgraph
        to bits, and the unserializer can compute just about any function from
        bits to any resulting value. The reconstructed subgraph <i>can</i> be
        arbitrarily different than the original. This makes any general specification
        mostly vacuous. Rather, the framework provides guidance and tools that
        encourage a certain style of use. Most of all, we assume that the serializer
        and unserializer are each designed to the intention that the reconstructed
        graph be somehow <i>meaningfully similar to the original, but with differences
        as needed in order to satisfy other goals</i>. These differences are the
        result of the structured mixing of four sources of intention: in dominance
        order, that of the unserializer, the reconstructed objects from root to
        leaf, the serializer, and the original objects from root to leaf. </p>
      <p>In other words, the unserializer builds whatever new objects it likes
        (subject to the limits of what objects it <i>can</i> build), but it normally
        chooses to build along the lines of its interpretation of the intentions
        of the serializer, as recorded in the depiction. The serializer paints
        whatever depiction it wishes (subject to the limits of what knowledge
        it can gain), but it normally chooses to depict along the lines of each
        original object's expressed intentions of how and whether it would like
        to be portrayed. Each object portrays that its alleged instance variables
        -- the set of references it would have the serializer represent as its
        state and further traverse from there -- is any set of references it likes
        (subject to the limits of what references it can produce). The subgraph
        the serializer is able to perceive is therefore not the real subgraph
        of objects in memory, but rather a kind of story spun by the objects being
        traversed.</p>
      <p> This impressionistic notion of serialization is mostly <i>not</i> a
        design choice. For us, it is a necessary consequence of insisting that
        our serialization system play the same rules imposed on all other objects.
        Objects cannot perceive each other's true state; rather, they perceive
        only what other objects claim in response to messages. <font color="#FF0000">(***

        </i>--Friedrich Hayek [Hayek78]</p>
      <p>When all these expressions of intent reflect the code written by one
        programmer all at once, then they are all aspects of one underlying intent,
        and the architecture for composing intentions may not matter so much.
        When they are written by different programmers at different times in different
        companies, all with little knowledge of each other's specifics, then the
        architecture should be well adapted to the expected locality of knowledge
        -- demanding from each component the expression of intent which that component
        is in a better position to contribute. It should compose these together
        into a result which successfully utilizes more knowledge than any one
        component plausibly has. JOSS does quite well at this. The Data-E architecture
        presented below does similarly well for similar reasons -- partially as
        a result of thinking about and learning from JOSS.</p>
      <p>We need to compose not only diverse knowledge, but also diverse (and
        possibly hostile) interests. When these all seek only literal accuracy
        (the default behavior), and when all the objects to be depicted are transparent
        (defined below), then the result must be according to Literal Realism.
        Given this, we can explain the effects of each kind of customization in
        terms of how it causes the result to deviate from Literal Realism, and
        of how multiple customizations interact.</p>

        So, in literal realism, the reconstructed subgraph is a perfect replica.
        It cannot be an imperfect heir, since the issue cannot arise.</p>
      <p>The quoted text continues:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Finally, if we redirect all external links into the graph rooted by
          x to the respective nodes of the graph rooted by y, no difference must
          be observable when the VM proceeds.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If the hypothetical redirection described above were to actually be performed,
        then we have a perfect reincarnation in addition to perfect replication.
      </p>
      <p>Our <a href="#preview">first preview example</a> happens to achieve perfect
        reincarnation trivially, since all the objects involved are <i>selfless</i>
        -- they have no creation (EQ) identity, only value equality. For example,
        two 3s are the same independent of when they were &quot;created&quot;.
        By contrast, the <a href="#capsule-example">example capsule</a> is <i>selfish</i>,
        with each instance having its own identity endowed at creation. Mozart
        makes a similar distinction. </p>
      <h1><a name="uses"></a>Other Uses for Serialization</h1>
      <p>The secure serialization abstractions presented in this paper are surprisingly
        similar to conventional serialization, but are not identical. We are not
        somehow taking serialization and adding security while leaving everything
        else alone. The changes we have made no doubt break some of the uses made
        of conventional serialization. Have we thrown the baby out with the bath
        water? To evaluate this, it helps to keep in mind a range of purposes
        serialization is used for. In addition to the distribution and persistence
        issues mentioned above, we believe the abstractions proposed in this paper
        are adequate for the following purposes:</p>
