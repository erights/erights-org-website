      <h1><a name="lessons"></a>Lessons of <i>Persistence and Upgrade</i></h1>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">(*** To be written)</font></p>
      <h1>In Praise of Manual Persistence</h1>
      <p>Computers crash too often. We wish our applications, data, and activities
        to last much longer. To achieve this, traditionally, programmers had to
        encode their application's representations twice -- once as a live runtime
        data structure and once as schema: as a file or database format to be
        saved to disk. This was the pain of <i>manual persistence</i>. Transparent
        orthogonal persistence was first conceived as a way to avoid this error-prone
        redundancy, essentially by masking the crash [KeyKOS, EROS, PJama]. A
        process running in such a system proceeds essentially as if no crash had
        happened. Such a process has an easy immortality, and the original persistence
        problem is solved.</p>
      <p >The <i>upgrade</i> problem occurs when we wish our application data
        to survive a different kind of trauma -- the upgrade of the code the application
        instantiates. When using manual persistence, the upgrade problem is properly
        the <i>schema evolution</i> problem -- to design, along with a new release
        of an application, means for converting its persistent schema from an
        old representation to the new one. For example, later releases of an editor
        typically know how to read documents written by earlier releases.</p>
      <p >However, if one uses transparent orthogonal persistence <i>instead</i>
        of manual persistence, then the entire runtime representation becomes
        the schema that needs to evolve. This amplifies the difficulty of the
        upgrade problem, often to a fatal extent. Manual persistence provides
        a source of great leverage for upgrade, and one that's easy to miss: By
        encoding their representation twice, programmers naturally bring to each
        encoding those concerns specific to the purpose of that encoding, often
        without thinking about this dichotomy explicitly.</p>
      <p  align="center"><i>Do you, Programmer,<br>
        take this Object to be part of the persistent state of your application,<br>
        to have and to hold,<br>
        through maintenance and iterations,<br>
        for past and future versions,<br>
        as long as the application shall live?</i></p>
      <p  align="right">--Arturo Bejar [ref StateBundles]</p>
      <p >Normally, we view the design of the runtime representation of our application
        as the "real" one, and wish the persistent state to be derived from it.
        But as this quote from Arturo suggests, the kind of commitment one needs
        to invest in persistent state isn't appropriate for runtime data structures,
        and shouldn't be. Runtime data structures are often delicate complex machines
        in motion, with many complex distributed consistency assumptions between
        the parts, designed to interact efficiently with an ongoing world of users
        or devices, and encoding meaning in ways that are largely undocumented.
        The complexity of this runtime world traditionally relies on the program
        itself staying constant while the process is executing. </p>
      <p >By contrast, when programmers design schema for manual persistence,
        Arturo's question is properly uppermost on their mind. These schema are
        stable representations designed with little redundancy, few opportunities
        for distributed inconsistency, with little penalty for inefficient representations,
        encoding only the essential application state that needs to survive across
        time, and where this encoding is much more likely to be well documented.
        Runtime representations emphasize the operational, whereas schema emphasize
        the declarative.</p>
      <p >Once the customers of an application accumulate their own privately
        held persistent state from this application, such as their own private
        documents, then Arturo's question becomes unavoidable. To release a new
        version of an application without losing old customers, one must enable
        those customers to revive their old state into an instantiation of the
        new version of the application reliably -- with no per-instance programmer
        intervention.</p>
      <table cellpadding="12" align="right" bgcolor="#FFFFE8" border="1"  width="30%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>Smalltalk, with its easy support for live upgrade, is not a counter-example.
              This support cannot be made reliable, and is instead designed for
              programmers-as-customers who know how to recover from inconsistencies.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p >If the programmers were using only transparent orthogonal persistence
        to give the application's data long life, then this upgrade problem resembles
        maintenance on an operational (though suspended) machine whose workings
        may be largely mysterious. Worse, since upgrades must happen in an automated
        way on customer data without programmers present, it more closely resembles
        building an upgrade-robot that will reliably perform this maintenance
        on any possible state such a machine may be in. With machines of great
        complexity, the feasible changes will usually only be minor tweaks and
        adjustments, not major design changes. The difficulty of upgrade will
        place a severe limit on the speed with which a vendor will be able to
        improve their program. This kind of persistence indeed provides a process
        with easy immortality, but only as a living fossil.</p>
      <p >If, on the other hand, the programmers were using manual persistence
        (whether through foresight, habit, or lack of an alternative), then, when
        they wish to release a new version, the total number of semantically significant
        cases in the schema should usually be small enough that they can each
        be thought about carefully, in order to see how to convert its meaning
        into the closest appropriate meaning in the application's new version.
        The upgrade-robot arrives with parameterized blueprints (the new version
        of the program) for building a new running machine (instantiating a new
        running process). The schema provides the arguments needed to complete
        the blueprint. The old machine is scrapped and a new machine is freshly
        built around these arguments. </p>
      <p >As another analogy, if the runtime representation is the application
        instance's phenotype, then the schema is the instance's genotype. Biological
        evolution works partially because it operates only on the genotype, where
        a genotype unfolds into the vastly more complex phenotype via the indirect
        operational process of embryology. Like an ephemeral live process instantiating
        an application (ie, a vat incarnation), each phenotype operates only from
        a fixed snapshot of its genotype. Evolution only happens in the transition
        between generations. While we needn't take these analogies too seriously,
        they can significantly aid our intuitions.</p>
      <p >Having made the greater initial investment in engineering two representations,
        the programmers using manual-persistence will then be able to improve
        their application much faster without losing their customers, perhaps
        overtaking the head start of the harder-to-evolve but faster time-to-market
        singly represented alternative.</p>
      <p >The first step in dealing with the schema evolution problem is to mostly
        avoid the problem by saving vastly smaller schema.</p>

        computational model.</font></p>
      <h2> Manual Revival as Zero-Delta Upgrade</h2>
      <p >Note that none of the above discussion assumes that transparent orthogonal
        persistence and largely manual persistence are exclusive options. A system
        may well use both: transparent orthogonal persistence to mask crashes
        efficiently [KeyKOS, EROS], and largely manual persistence only when upgrading.
        A future <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>-on-EROS may very
        well operate in this mode. In this scenario, performance need not be a
        goal of the largely manual system.</p>
      <p >In the absence of support for high speed transparent orthogonal persistence,
        a system may very well use largely manual persistence mechanism for both
        purposes. Each post-crash revival is then a degenerate zero-delta upgrade:
        Each revival runs through the upgrade-supporting logic each time, even
        when no upgrade is actually occurring. The current <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        running on Java running on stock OSes, operates in this mode. Performance
        therefore should be a goal of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s
        persistence mechanisms, but is not at this time.</p>
      <h2> Mechanism / Policy Separation</h2>
      <p >Of course, by definition, anything a program does is automated, so what
        do we even mean by "manual" persistence? We are not arguing against automation,
        abstraction, and reuse. Rather the issue is whether to build a primitively
        provded inescapable comprehensive solution <i>vs.</i> a toolkit of reusable
        tools from which one can roll one's own solution, or several co-existing
        ones. When one can design a single solution adequate for the needed range
        of uses, often one should, as the uniformity of a single comprehensive
        solution can bring great benefits. When one size doesn't fit all, we should
        instead turn to the tradition of <i>mechanism / policy</i> separation.
        A toolkit can serve as the mechanisms out of which one may build a variety
        of persistence systems embodying a (limited) range of policy choices.</p>
      <p >What we mean by "manual" persistence is that the <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
        kernel does not itself provide a primitive persistence system, but rather
        provides primitive tools out of which persistence systems may be fashioned.
        The <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> system as a whole does
        provide a default persistence system built "manually" from these tools,
        but this has the status of library code rather than fundamental primitives.
        Multiple such libraries can coexist, and the default one is in no sense
        special.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">*** incoherent notes here to the end of this file.
        Do Not Read ****</font> </p>
      <p ></p>
      <p >The tool most central to such a toolkit is a serialization / unserialization
        system. <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> currently uses Java's
        serialization streams, which has a rather flexible and mature set of customization
        hooks for building streams embodying a wide range of serialization policies.
        Most of the goals of our toolkit are already achieved by Java's serialization
        design, so this paper proceeds from there.</p>
      <p>Here, we wish to support a range of compromises between the explicitness
        and separation of concerns of manual persistence <i>vs.</i> the economy
        of expression provided by automating aspects of persistence. Why a range
        of compromises? Why not try to find one good compromise and just build
        that? Because there are too many kinds of persistence policies that plausibly
        need to be supported.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What to save/restore <i>vs.</i> what to reconstruct <i>vs.</i> what
          to reconnect. (More on this below.)</li>
        <li>Where to save persistent state? Files? Databases?</li>
        <li>When to revive saved state? On process (vat) revival, or faulting
          on-demand?</li>
        <li>Fail-stop vs. best efforts. When problems are hit, either saving or
          restoring, should one give up or make due?</li>
        <li>What is a consistent state, and how does one obtain access such a
          state? Does such a state include messages in flight?</li>
        <li>Transactions: When is a saved state a basis for commitment? How does
          one abort and fall back to a previous state? As separate subsystems
          asynchronously snapshot, how is consistency recovered when they revive
          from different times?
          <p >Faced with such a variety, we use the traditional answer: mechanism
            / policy separation. We have built persistence support into <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
            in two layers:</p>
          A set of building blocks from which an application developer can (within
          limits) build a persistence system embodying those policies that serve
          their needs, including a fully manual system if desired. These mechanisms
          must not allow an unprivileged persistence subsystem from violating
          any of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s security properties,
          while allowing for operation that's reasonable for a subsystem holding
          a given set of authorities.</li>
        <li>One example persistence system, built only from these building blocks,
          embodying a set of policy choices that won't be suitable for all applications,
          but is nevertheless designed to be widely reused.
