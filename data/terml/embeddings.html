      <p>In order to be suitable for use as a universal language for representing 
        trees of symbols, TermL must be able to naturally represent the major 
        other widespread universal trees-of-symbol languages, such as XML, S-Expressions, 
        and tree-oriented object serialization.</p>
      <p><i>The embedding of XML into TermL owes a tremendous debt to Oleg Kiselyov's 
        <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html">SXML</a>.</i></p>
      <p><i>The style shown below for serializing object graphs into TermL is 
        inspired by Tyler Close's XML-based object serialization.</i></p>
      <h1><a name="xmlattrs"></a>Embedding XML </h1>
      <h2>XML Attributes and Elements</h2>
      <p>Like TermL terms, an XML Element contains a sequence of child Elements, 
        so these concepts can map directly. An XML Element also contains a set, 
        not a sequence, of name-value pairs, or <i>attributes</i>. An example 
        valid in HTML and XHTML (HTML4 encoded in XML):</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot; color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;foo&lt;b&gt;bar&lt;/b&gt;baz&lt;/font&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This can be written in TermL as follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>font({size: &quot;3&quot;, color: &quot;#FF0000&quot;},
     &quot;foo&quot;, b(&quot;bar&quot;), &quot;baz&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The curly brackets indicate that order should not be taken as significant 
        among the terms within the curly brackets. The ':' shorthand is used for 
        attributes to emphasize that the attribute isn't of self-contained meaning, 
        but is rather an encoding of properties of the enclosing Element.</p>
      <p>The above is syntactic shorthand for:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>font(.bag.(.attr.(size(&quot;3&quot;)), .attr.(color(&quot;#FF0000&quot;))),
     &quot;foo&quot;, b(&quot;bar&quot;), &quot;baz&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since the <tt>.bag.</tt> functor cannot correspond to any XML-QName, 
        an XML-oriented interpreter of this term-tree knows that this first argument 
        is to be interpreted as holding attributes. If an Element has no attributes, 
        this optional first argument may be omitted. If an Element has no children, 
        such as the following XHTML,</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>&lt;img alt=&quot;ELM architecture&quot; src=&quot;eLanguageMachine.gif&quot; /&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>then the parentheses which would enclose only the attributes can be left 
        out:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>img{alt: &quot;ELM architecture&quot;, src: &quot;eLanguageMachine.gif&quot;}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>which is shorthand for</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>img(.bag.(.attr.(alt(&quot;ELM architecture&quot;)), .attr.(src(&quot;eLanguageMachine.gif&quot;))))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="namespaces"></a>XML Namespaces</h3>
      <p>A tag can be used to represent both unresolved and resolved <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-QName">XML-QName</a>s. 
        An unresolved XML-QName is written as it is in XML -- as a Prefix, a separator, 
        and a LocalPart. However, in TermL the separator is '::' instead of ':'. 
        As explained by <a href="http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm">XML Namespaces</a>, 
        the semantics of an unresolved XML-QName is represented by the corresponding 
        resolved XML-QName. An XML-QName is resolved by substituting for the Prefix 
        the URI which is the namespace name found by evaluating this Prefix in 
        the current namespace scope. An example from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML-NS</a>:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!-- both namespace prefixes are available throughout --&gt;
&lt;bk:book xmlns:bk='urn:loc.gov:books'
         xmlns:isbn='urn:ISBN:0-395-36341-6'&gt;
    &lt;bk:title&gt;Cheaper by the Dozen&lt;/bk:title&gt;
    &lt;isbn:number&gt;1568491379&lt;/isbn:number&gt;
&lt;/bk:book&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Written manually in TermL without resolving XML-QNames:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>xml(.pi.(&quot;version&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;),
    .comment.(&quot;both namespace prefixes are available throughout&quot;),
    .letns.({bk: &lt;urn:loc.gov:books&gt;,
             isbn: &lt;urn:ISBN:0-395-36341-6&gt;},
            bk::book(bk::title: &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;,
                     isbn::number: 1568491379)))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As seen above, we follow <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html">SXML</a>'s 
        example and represent additional XML node types, like processing instructions 
        or comments, by using <a href="terml-spec.html#special">special</a> tags 
        as functors, like <tt>.pi.</tt> or <tt>.comment.</tt>.</p>
      <p><i>An automated translation would need some kind of schema or type information 
        in order to translate the isbn number to </i><tt>1568491379</tt><i> rather 
        than </i><tt>&quot;1568491379&quot;</tt><i>.</i></p>
      <p>Despite the syntax of XML, modern XML infosets (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML-Infoset</a>) do not 
        treat namespace definitions as attributes. Rather, the set of namespace 
        definitions in scope at an Element is yet another first-class part of 
        the Element, in addition to the Element's tag, attributes, and child Elements. 
        Namespace defintions are lexically scoped and shadowed in the conventional 
        manner, though the syntax of XML obscures this as well -- in the XML example 
        above, the &quot;<tt>bk</tt>&quot; in the first &quot;<tt>bk:book</tt>&quot; 
        is resolved in the scope of the &quot;<tt>bk</tt>&quot; defintion that 
        occurs textually to its right. To embedding XML in TermL, we emphasize 
        the conventional lexical semantics of these definitions by introducing 
        a separate <tt>.letns.</tt> construct, similar to the Scheme <tt>let</tt>.</p>
      <p>Transforming the above term-tree through a (yet to be written) <tt>.letns.</tt> 
        resolver tool, we'd get:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>xml(.pi.(&quot;version&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;),
    .comment.(&quot;both namespace prefixes are available throughout&quot;),
    &lt;urn:loc.gov:books&gt;::book(&lt;urn:loc.gov:books&gt;::title: &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;,
                              &lt;urn:ISBN:0-395-36341-6&gt;::number: 1568491379))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The first form is easier for humans to read and (especially) write. The 
        second is easier for programs to manipulate. </p>
      <p><i>Note that the latter does not retain all the information defined to 
        be significant by modern XML infosets. These require that the Prefix and 
        redundant namespace definitions be retained. Therefore, it is an application-specific 
        decision to employ the resolver tool. Most applications do not care about 
        the information that would be thrown away by such a tool.</i></p>
      <p>Speculative: With this embedding of XML into TermL, an XML DTD or a <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/">Relax-NG 
        Schema</a> can be translated into a TermL Schema (yet to be defined), 
        such that an XML document D1 valid according to Schema S1 would translate 
        to a TermL term-tree D2 valid according to translated Schema S2.</p>

      <h1><a name="json"></a>Embedding <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a> in TermL</h1>
      <p>TermL is now a superset of JSON, and so all of JSON embeds trivially. 
        As of this writing, TermL parsed all examples on <a href="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/example.html">the 
        JSON examples page</a>, and detected that the third example was missing 
        a close-curly.</p>
      <h1><a name="sexprs"></a>Embedding S-Expressions in TermL</h1>
      <p>Readers already familiar with S-Expressions may be puzzled at this point. 
        Why is any embedding needed at all? Aren't term-trees and S-Expressions 
        equivalent except for syntax? Surprisingly, the answer is no. There are 
        four differences altogether, of which the first is syntax.</p>

      <p>By this table, it seems that S-Expressions are more expressive than term-trees. 
        Indeed, this is the case, in the sense that an embedding of TermL into 
        S-Expressions is more trivial than the reverse. To embed S-Expressions 
        into TermL we translate lists into square-bracketed lists, which is really 
        a shorthand for use of the <tt>.tuple.</tt> functor. </p>
      <table cellpadding="12" bgcolor="#80ffff">
        <tr> 
          <th>S-Expressions</th>
          <th align="left">TermL Embedding</th>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> <pre>(f a b)</pre></td>
          <td> <pre>[f, a, b]</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> <pre>((a b) (c d)</pre></td>
          <td> <pre>[[a, b], [c, d]]</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> <pre>f != (f)</pre></td>
          <td> <pre>f != [f]</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> <pre>(a . rest)</pre></td>
          <td> <pre>.cons.(a, rest)</pre></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This takes care of all cases but the dotted pair, for which we introduce 
        the <tt>.cons.</tt> functor. By this embedding, the S-Expression</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>(lambda (a b) (plus a b))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>translates to</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>[lambda, [a, b], [plus, a, b]]</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>However, this embedding is besides the point. Most actual <i>uses</i> 
        of S-Expressions can be described by a Schema of some sort. For example, 
        in the Scheme language, if the first member of a list is one of a distinguished 
        set of symbols, then the list is interpreted as a primitive special form. 
        Otherwise, it is interpreted as a function call. A more useful embedding 
        of Scheme into TermL would be based on recognizing the &quot;Schema&quot; 
        describing how Scheme is represented in S-Expressions. Using such a Schema, 
        and taking the above S-Expression to be a Scheme program, we may instead 
        translate it as:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>lambda(params(a, b), apply(plus, a, b))</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>or</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>lambda(params(var(&quot;a&quot;), var(&quot;b&quot;)), apply(var(&quot;plus&quot;), 
          var(&quot;a&quot;), var(&quot;b&quot;)))</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Although the first is less readable than the original, it is still sufficiently 
        readable for human manipulation. Unfortunately, only the second is in 
        the form of a proper AST of the Scheme program that could be validated 
        against a Scheme Schema. Why? A Schema should use a finite number of tags 
        to describe a finite number of functor kinds. Only the latter form uses 
        tags only to distinguish AST node types. Because of the inherent tradeoff 
        here, the TermL Schema language should include an optional default-tag 
        clause, specifying the translation of unrecognized leaf tags into a normalized 
        form. (The kind of translation implied above would not work for a non-leaf 
        tag, but then again, a Schema-based translation could not produce an unrecognized 
        non-leaf tag.)</p>

      <h1><a name="serial"></a>Serializing Object Graphs</h1>
      <p><i><font color="#FF0000">*** We are now planning to serialize object 
        graphs using <a href="../serial/jhu-paper/index.html">Data-E</a> instead. 
        Nevertheless, the following hypothetical serialization style is interesting.</font></i></p>
      <p>XML has the four main features needed for a human manipulable upgradeable 
        embedding of object graphs into a tree-oriented textual notation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <p><b>Typed nodes</b>. XML Elements are &quot;typed&quot; by the Element 
            tag name. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><b>An unordered set of name-value pairs</b>. A programmer's view 
            of an object's state is a mapping from instance variable names to 
            the values of those instance variables. The order of the instance 
            variables is not part of the semantics of the program, is not memorable, 
            and so should not be relied on for the textual encoding. By using 
            an order-independent name-based encoding, serialized data is more 
            likely to remain valid for latter versions of the object's definition. 
            XML attributes have exactly these properties.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><b>Recursive data definition</b>. Just as object A can refer to object 
            B, which can refer to object C, to any depth, so a serialization format 
            should be based on nodes that can refer to other nodes and so on to 
            any depth. XML Elements are the primary nodes of an XML tree, and 
            they can indeed be recursively embedded to any depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><b>Non-local references</b>. In order to embed a tree in a graph, 
            some form of non-local reference is needed, so that the same subtree 
            may be referred to from multiple places (ie, have multiple parents). 
            XML provides for this with ID and IDREF type attributes.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Unfortunately, XML is defined so that the virtues of #2 and #3 cannot 
        be used together. Since #3 is a requirement, the virtues of #2 have to 
        be independently recreated as an encoding in terms of Elements. For example, 
        many XML-based serialization formats use Element tags for instance variable 
        names, as in</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>&lt;org.erights.example.Point&gt;
    &lt;x&gt;33&lt;/x&gt;
    &lt;y&gt;44&lt;/y&gt;
&lt;/org.erights.example.Point&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In TermL, we would instead write:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>org.erights.example.Point{x: 33,
                          y: 44}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The correspondence between these examples closely follows that of the 
        XML-to-TermL embedding presented previously. However, by the logic of 
        that previous embedding, we are treating the set of instance variables 
        as attributes. Since TermL has no primitive notion of attributes, the 
        value of such an &quot;attribute&quot; can be any term, so we naturally 
        combine virtues #2 and #3 from the above list.</p>
      <h4>Non-local References</h4>
      <p align="center"><img src="../../elang/concurrency/images/mvc.gif" width="282" height="278"></p>
      <p>Starting at View, the depicted object graph may be represented as</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>.id.(1, View{model: .id.(2, Model{...}),
             contrl: Controller{model: .idref.(2),
                               view: .idref.(1)}})</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We introduce the special functor of two arguments <tt>.id.</tt>, which, 
        like an XML ID-typed attribute, causes the second argument (the value) 
        to be identified by the first argument (the index). The index should be 
        an integer, and be unique among all indexes in this serialization. The 
        scope of the index extends from its defining occurrence, left-to-right 
        for the rest of the term-tree. We also introduce the special functor <tt>.idref.</tt>, 
        whose one argument is an in-scope index, that decodes into another reference 
        to the value already associated with that index.</p>
      <p><i>By contrast, an XML ID-typed attribute's scope is the entire document, 
        enabling forward as well as backwards references. For ease of unserializing, 
        the embedding described here uses the more restrictive left-to-right scope 
        that allows only backwards references.</i></p>
      <p>Previously, our hypothetical <tt>.letns.</tt> resolver tool above could 
        be used for TermL representations other than the XML embedding, so long 
        as they follow the <tt>.letns.</tt> convention. Likewise, a converter 
        between TermL trees and TermL graphs could be used for any TermL representations 
        that follow the <tt>.id.</tt> and <tt>.idref.</tt> conventions, whether 
        or not these graphs are ultimately an encoding of objects. For such TermL 
        representations, Schema validations should be applied to the graph form 
        rather than the tree form.</p>
      <p>To serialize a typed object graph (eg, for Java) into a validating TermL 
        representation, for each type of object serialized, the corresponding 
        representation type is added to the schema as the constraints for that 
        type tag. The resulting schema can only be used to validate a TermL graph. 
        This is a perfect example where tree-valiadtion would be completely useless.</p>
      <h4>Primitive Types</h4>
      <p>Primitive integer, float64, character, and string data are just encoded 
        with the corresponding literals. A ConstList is encoded using the square 
        bracket shorthand, or the <tt>.tuple.</tt> tag when written out in longhand.</p>
