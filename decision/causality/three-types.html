        Types of Causality (was: Modelling Blindness)</a></p>
      <p>Different kinds of subject matter and different purposes of analysis 
        demand use of different kinds of causal reasoning. At one extreme is moral 
        causality -- the issues of accountability, of assigning blame and responsibility. 
        At the other extreme is the physicist's causality -- the &quot;for want 
        of a nail&quot; world where everything depends of everything else. Between 
        the two is the &quot;explanatory causality&quot; of (at least) intellectual 
        and military history, where we seek explanations that help us form mental 
        models of the world, of how it worked and works, and of how best we may 
        effect it.</p>
      <hr>
      <h1>Moral Causality</h1>
      <p>When a murder mystery asks &quot;Did the butler do it?&quot;, it is posing 
        a question in the realm of moral causality. If the butler did it, then 
        he is to be held responsible, blamed, and perhaps punished. (I am glossing 
        over here the huge gulf between moral and legal reasoning.) </p>
      <p>I'll avoid the current e-lang example of terrorism for reasons I'll be 
        happy to explain privately, and I'd like others to avoid further discussion 
        of it on e-lang as well. Using the Holocaust as an example, I believe 
        the consensus blame on Hitler, Eichmann, and many others is appropriate. 
        For the mass murders of communism, I believe it is appropriate to blame 
        at least Stalin and Mao.</p>
      <h1> The Causality of the Physicist</h1>
      <p>The weather is thought to be everywhere sensitive to initial conditions. 
        This means that the famed &quot;butterfly effect&quot; is pervasive. If 
        you go sufficient far back, had just about any one input been different, 
        today's weather would be rather unrelated to the weather we actually have. 
        Many different aspects of reality are plausibly like the weather in this 
        regard, though plausibly at vastly different time scales. </p>
      <p>In this sense, the Holocaust and communism were caused by just about 
        everything that happened in ancient Mesopotamian, including the Epic of 
        Gilgamesh.</p>
      <h1>Explanatory Causality</h1>
      <div align="right">The world is built from <i>systems</i>. People understand 
        <i>stories</i>.<br>
        --Alan Kay </div>
      <p>When we look back for causal chains, often our purpose is to figure out 
        what to do in the complex world we find ourselves in. This complex world 
        is &quot;actually&quot; the result of all the causal chains the physicist 
        might have us enumerate, but this &quot;true&quot; explanation is often 
        too broad for figuring out what to do -- enumerating everything doesn't 
        convey much more information that enumerating nothing. When the &quot;what 
        to do&quot; is &quot;who to blame or punish&quot;, then we turn to moral 
        causality, which one hopes gives the narrowest answers.</p>
      Intermediate is what I call &quot;explanatory causality&quot;, the world 
      of stories abstracted from a complex history, simplified in order to let 
      us build mental models we can use to (at least) 
      <ol>
        <li>figure out how to imitate success, 
        <li>avoid repeating history's mistakes, 
        <li>project expectations of the world well beyond our data. 
      </ol>
      <p>#1 and #2 are fairly conventional. By #3, I mean that each of us only 
        has direct experience of only a tiny bit of reality. (Yes, as a good Popperian, 
        I know we don't have &quot;direct&quot; experience of anything at all. 
        I'm glossing over that.) However, we each have vast predictive models 
        that give us expectations about parts of the world we haven't encountered 
        yet. We often get surprised, and we hope that we're constantly adjusting 
        our predictive models in light of these surprises. A major form of predictive 
        model we're built to use is the causal model. However, we're built to 
        predict not because predictive accuracy is an end in itself, but in order 
        for these predictions lead us into taking actions that are more effective. 
        This leads to a strong selective pressure on kinds of causal explanation, 
        and in particular, on what kinds of simplifications we should always be 
        making.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we were not built to have a strong wall separating moral 
        causality and explanatory causality, and much immoral brutality has come 
        from confusing the two. Fortunately, the modern world has invented the 
        concept of this wall, and this distinction does seem to be something people 
        can hold in their head and successfully act on. </p>
      <p>When Hayek came out with &quot;The Road To Serfdom&quot;, he was personally, 
        bitterly, and viciously slandered by many representatives of the intellectual 
        consensus that he was challenging. They engaged in a great smear campaign 
        to label him (in different words) the great Satan of economists, and they 
        succeeded for a generation. However, during his entire intellectual career, 
        including this period of time, he never ever accused his enemies of anything 
        other than intellectual error. I'm sure he privately felt that some blame 
        would be just, and perhaps he made some private comments to this effect 
        to friends (though I know of no reports of such). In the short term, he 
        lost the mudslinging battle. In the long term, he won the moral high ground.</p>
      <p>On the issue of intellectual error by itself, Hayek was quite vigorous 
        in his criticism, as was he in explaining causal pathways in intellectual 
        history where one mistake led to another. Hayek lived to see his ideas 
        triumph, largely by virtue of his causal stories of the world, in particular 
        over the pervasive (at the time) socialism and communism of the world. 
        His explanations displaced previous causal stories that were in the air, 
        that prevented those holding them from seeing a way out.</p>
      <p>So, returning to our examples, we see through Hayek's stories that Darwin, 
        Malthus, and Newton were among the causes of the Holocaust and communism. 
        Clearly Hayek does not intend to blame these thinkers for these events 
        -- indeed he has raised even further our regard for Darwin. At the same 
        time, clearly Hayek means something distinct from a statement that the 
        Epic of Gilgamesh caused these events. The latter statement leads to no 
        change of behavior whatsoever. The &quot;insight&quot; it offers leaves 
        us helpless. But by offering an explanation of how the ideas of socialism 
        derived from these thinkers, we can understand the roots of their errors 
        in a deeper way, in order to better refute these errors when they appear 
        in other guises.</p>
      <h1>Commentary on Past Discussion on e-lang</h1>
      <p>Along with Tyler, I also believe we've been keeping the discussion at 
        a proper non-blaming intellectual-error level. I have made personal remarks 
        off list that were inappropriate, but I don't hold my private conversations 
        to as high a standard. In any case, since we're all agreed about what 
        we should do, we needn't engage in more exploration of what we have done.</p>
      <p>However, I think that</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>At 10:32 AM 12/12/2002 Thursday, Jonathan S. Shapiro <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2002-December/007970.html">wrote</a>:
&gt;<i>Let us begin by putting this paper in context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The Protection paper was written in 1971. Butler was 28 years old. He
</I>&gt;<i>had just arrived [...]</i></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>confuses the issue yet again. I don't care who Butler was at the time, 
        what his situation was, or whether this paper was labeled &quot;workshop&quot;, 
        &quot;draft&quot;, or whatever. I would only care about these issues if 
        I was interested in assessing blame, which I'm not.</p>
      <p>I am interested in understand and explaining how the world got into its 
        current screwed up state on computer security, even though the right idea 
        goes back to 1966 and a scientific process was supposedly in place. I 
        am especially interesting in understanding this in service of figuring 
        out what to do about it. I think many of us feel that &quot;Protection&quot; 
        had a crucial role to play in the sequence of events. I think Shap disagrees. 
        Great, that's the kind of argument best explored by a hermeneutic process 
        of interpreting of history, including a hermeneutic interpretation of 
        the documents whose role in the history is under dispute.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, none of us may currently have the time for this process 
        -- I know I don't. But perhaps someday... We write for future intellectual 
        history as well.</p>
