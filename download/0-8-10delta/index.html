      <h1><a name="Highlights"></a>Highlights of this Version</h1>
      <p>As each of these issues are discussed in email or in the bug tracking
        system, we will link the paragraphs below to the relevant roots.</p>
      <h3>MarcS' eDesk -- Visual POLA for Caplets</h3>


      <blockquote>
        <p>eDesk is a desktop and designed-to-be-secure(*) computing environment
          built on the E platform, for the installation and running of <i>caplets</i>
          -- capability-based applets/applications that run with only the authority
          that has been explicitly given to them.</p>
        <p>A secure computing architecture means little for its human users unless
          its security principles are brought out to the user interface in an
          intuitive, usable, and non-accident prone fashion. The key insight is,
          once again, Norm's: &quot;<i>A capability combines designation with
          authority.</i>&quot;</p>
        <p>Modern user interfaces are the result of billions of dollars of work
          on the designation problem -- how to tell one thing, designated somehow,
          to perform some operation of some other thing, also somehow designated.
          As user interfaces have improved, they have also moved towards more
          capability-like means of designation, as in the moves from names and
          clipboards to drag-n-drop.</p>
        <p>As with Miriam &amp; Ping's <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Epingster/sec/project/">Interaction
          Design for End-User Security</a>, the main &quot;trick&quot; of eDesk
          is to bundle authorization in with these acts of designation. For example,
          when a capEdit -- our text editor caplet -- requests a file to edit,
          the file dialog box that pops up enables the user to conventionally
          designate which file the caplet should edit, but in so doing, in the
          same act, provides the caplet the authority to do this editing.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>(*) eDesk won't really be secure until the &quot;Taming Java&quot;
          work mentioned below is adequately complete.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Term Trees, for real this time</h3>
	  <blockquote>
        <p>John McCarthy has said: &quot;<i>XML is just S-Expressions, only ten
          times as verbose.</i>&quot; This comparison, while critical of XML,
          helps explain the source of its appeal -- for most of the computing
          world, XML is the first S-Expression-like system they've seen. What
          XML, S-Expressions, Antlr ASTs (abstract syntax trees), and Prolog Term
          trees have in common is that they are notations (or surface syntaxes)
          for &quot;practically universal&quot; trees of symbols. These trees
          are &quot;practically universal&quot; in that many other forms of symbolic
          data can be mapped into any of these trees. </p>
        <p>The clearest and most compelling case is the Antlr AST -- these are
          used to represent the result of parsing anything that can be parsed
          according to a BNF grammar. This demonstrates that one such universal
          data structures may have a great multitude of surface syntaxes.</p>
        <p>Each of these S-Expression-like systems provide somewhat different
          levels of syntactic overhead, provision for type specification, and
          semantic clarity. For the purposes of E, a simple, clear semantics (to
          enable quasi-literals and for security reasons) is required, and compatibility
          with Antlr is highly desired.</p>
        <p>Although the Antlr documentation also calls its ASTs S-Expressions,
          and although the Antlr notation for writing them looks like S-Expressions,
          semantically they are actually most similar to Prolog Term trees. Since
          Antlr is the system we most desire to interoperate with, as of this
          release we introduce E's Prolog-like Term trees, with conversions back
          and forth to Antlr ASTs. We also adopt a Prolog-like surface syntax
          for our Term trees, as that looks more familiar to the C syntactic tradition.
          For example, the parsed form of E's</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>a := &quot;x&quot; * 3</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>would be written</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>assignExpr(nounExpr(&quot;a&quot;),
           callExpr(literalExpr(&quot;x&quot;),
                    &quot;multiply&quot;,
                    literalExpr(3)))</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In an E Term, a <i>functor </i>is an identifier or a literal data element.
          An identifier, like &quot;assignExpr&quot; above, serves the same role
          as a does a tag name in XML. A literal data element is either a literal
          character, integer, floating point number, or string, written the same
          way, and meaning the same thing, as these literal data elements do in
          E. (This is the same as they do in Java, except that integers are precision
          unlimited, and floating point numbers are always double precision.)
          A <i>Term</i> always consists of a functor and zero or more arguments.
          These arguments are its children, which transitively always form a finite
          tree. The leaves of the tree are simply Terms with no arguments. For
          Terms with no arguments, the &quot;<tt>()</tt>&quot; is optional.</p>
        <p>We are working towards a quasi-parser for <a href="../../elang/grammar/quasi-terms.html">quasi-literal
          Term</a> expressions and patterns.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Taming the Java API with *.safej Files</h3>
	  <blockquote>
        <p>One of the more controversial aspects of E's history is our decision
          to build on the Java platform, among other things, in order to inherit
          its great wealth of libraries. The biggest problem with this plan is
          that the Java libraries were not designed according to capability discipline
          or style. The good news is that good modular object code is often very
          close to being good capability code, and much of the Java API that we
          wished to inherit was indeed close in this sense. So, in most cases,
          closing the remaining gap was more a matter of <i>taming</i> (or domesticating,
          or housebreaking) rather than wrapping or replacing with a redesign.</p>
        <p>Historically and still, this taming is done by hard coding within the
          E implementation. (Actually, it is partly data driven, by only by hard
          coded tables scattered through the E implementation.) This has worked
          for the scale of taming we have so far made implicitly available to
          *.emaker and *.caplet files, but is woefully inadequate for the actual
          needs of caplets. Caplets are generally interactive, and so need access
          to a substantial portion of the AWT and Swing APIs. These are too large
          for taming by hard coding.</p>
        <p>Instead, MarcS wrote a tool, the <i>capAnalyzer</i> (not yet released,
          but expect it soon), with which he interactively examined the relevant
          portions of the AWT and Swing APIs. The results of the analysis of each
          class are present, though unused, in this delta release as a Term tree
          in a *.safej file available in the e.jar as a resource:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>? print(&lt;resource:java/awt/AWTEvent.safej&gt;.getText().trim())
# stdout: class(&quot;java.awt.AWTEvent&quot;,
#               statics(method(suppress, &quot;new(Event)&quot;),
#                       method(suppress, &quot;new(Object, int)&quot;)),
#               methods(method(suppress, &quot;setSource(Object)&quot;),
#                       method(suppress, &quot;getID()&quot;),
#                       method(suppress, &quot;toString()&quot;),
#                       method(suppress, &quot;paramString()&quot;)))</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some parts of this are currently placeholders for expected taming info
          yet to come -- the <tt>byproxy</tt>, <tt>selfless</tt>, <tt>byconstruction</tt>,
          and <tt>persistent</tt> attributes, that will say whether instances
          of the class should be considered by E to have these properties. (Note
          that <tt>byconstruction</tt> and <tt>persistent</tt> both will
          require the class to be <tt>Serializable</tt>. <tt>byproxy</tt>
          excludes <tt>selfless</tt> or <tt>byconstruction</tt>.) &quot;true&quot;
          and &quot;false&quot; should not have quotes around them (my mistake).
          If a comment is present, it isn't for the purpose of a Javadoc comment
          on the method or class itself -- which we also perhaps need to capture
          in a resource, for use in interactive help -- but rather a comment explaining
          this taming decision, also perhaps useful in interactive help as an
          addendum to the Javadoc comment. Such a comment, if present, would be
          shown as a &quot;comment&quot; terms with a string argument.</p>
        <p>The most important field is the &quot;<tt>safe</tt>&quot; attribute.
          This says whether the class itself should be made implicitly importable
          by using the universally accessible <tt>&lt;import:...&gt;</tt>
          expression. If not, then the class is still importable by <tt>&lt;unsafe:...&gt;</tt>,
          which is available only in the privileged scope. The API of a class
          and its instances are to be tamed by the above description regardless
          of how it was imported.</p>
        <p>This delta release does not yet process these <tt>*.safej</tt> files
          at all. It still does its taming only by the far more conservative manual
          hard coding. As a result, the caplet environment contains unsafe <i>scaffolding</i>
          code -- code which grants to a caplet instance the ability to import
          untamed AWT and Swing classes. Until this scaffolding code is removed,
          we can only say that the caplet environment was architected to be secure,
          not that it is actually secure. We include the <tt>*.safej</tt> files
          in this release anyway so that y'all can have a look and double check
          our taming decisions before we make them operational. If you find any
          taming decision to even be puzzling, please let us know.</p>

      <p>A non-persistent <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> is called
        <i>time-local</i> since an object only exist as long as its hosting process
        does. A non-distributed <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        is called <i>space-local</i> if an object and all references to it only
        exist within its hosting process. </p>
      <p><font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> <i>by definition</i> provides
        distributed capability-security -- the ability for objects in mutually
        suspicious processes to safely cooperate. If it looks like <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        and it quacks like <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>, it
        might be a duck; but if it doesn't provide distributed capability security,
        it's not <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>. A system that's
        otherwise equivalent to <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>,
        but doesn't provide distributed capability security, is called <i>daffE</i>.
        A distributed <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> can only
        be implemented by means of strong crypto, of course, for which we are
        using code derived from the <a href="http://ai.cryptix.org/"> Cryptix</a>
        library (in accord with the terms of their open-source license). In a
        space-local system, no distributed insecurity can arise, so such a system
        would be an <font color="#009000"><i><b>sl-E</b></i></font> rather than
        an <i>sl-daffE</i>. </p>
      <p><font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> is designed to provide
        local capabillity-security -- the ability for mutually suspicious objects
        hosted by the same process to safely cooperate, and the use of capability
        discipline to determine which of its hosting process's authorities it
        may exercise. Such objects could be executing <i>untrusted code</i> --
        code that the hosting process (or its owner) doesn't need to fully trust.
      </p>
      <p><b>This is a &quot;complete&quot; release of E</b>. &quot;complete&quot;
        is in quotes, because both the persistence and the distribution leave
        much to be desired, as explained <a href="../0-8-10alpha/index.html">here</a>.
        However, these are close enough that this release that doesn't need qualifiers
        in its name.</p>

      <h3>Versions &amp; Types of Java</h3>
      <p>In refering to various versions of Java, we follow Sun's terminology
        and numbering. A Java Runtime, or <b>jre</b>, is adequate to run standard
        Java binary programs (class files &amp; resources). A Java Development
        Kit, or <b>jdk</b>, is adequate both to build a program from sources and
        to run it. A jdk is a superset of the corresponding jre, and their version
        numbers are always in synch. Each successive version of the jdk/jre from
        Sun effectively defines a new version of the Java &amp; JVM standards,
        except that Sun has introduced a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/java2.html">numbering
        inconsistency</a>: The Java/JVM 2.x standard corresponds to Sun's jdk/jre
        1.2.x. We ignore this inconsistency and refer to both as 1.2.x.</p>
      <p>This version of <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> requires
        a jre &gt;= 1.3.1. E no longer supports Java &lt; 1.3.1. To build <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        from sources, a corresponding jdk is required. </p>
      <p><i>Note: E does not install correctly when using JDK1.4beta on Windows2000
        -- it fails to exec with &quot;winfo.exe&quot; executable, used during
        install time to gather info about your Windows system. It seems to be
        a more general problem in execing executables. If you experience this
        problem, we suggest you install using a JDK1.3.*. Once installed, E should
        work fine with either JDK1.3.* or JDK1.4beta. <br>

      <h2>Build-Only Dependencies</h2>
      <p>If you are only installing <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        from a binary distribution, or only rebuilding the Java portion for your
        own use, you can ignore this section. However, if you wish to build an
        <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> distribution from sources,
        then you will need the equivalent of the following tools as well.</p>
      <h3>The <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/"><tt>Cygwin</tt></a>
        Distribution</h3>
      <p>The <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> building process relies
        on a number of UNIX tools. These are available for Windows from Cygnus
        Support as the Cygwin package. If you wish to build <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        on Windows, you should <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html">download</a>
        and install a version &gt;= 1.0.</p>
      <h3>BYacc/J (Berkeley Yacc for Java)</h3>
      <p>The E source distribution contains the executable binary program byaccj.exe
        for Windows, and <tt>byaccj</tt> for Linux/386/glibc. These are actually
        <a href="http://www.lincom-asg.com/%7Erjamison/byacc/">BYacc/Java</a>
        from Bob Jamison and <a href="http://www.lincom-asg.com/%7Erjamison/byacc/ACKNOWLEDGEMEN">others</a>.
        BYacc/Java is the Berkeley Yacc program extended with a &quot;-j&quot;
        flag and others for producing Java output. BYacc/Java is covered by the
        Berkeley License. If you are on a Unix system other than glibc Linux,
        you need to download your own version of <tt>byaccj</tt> and overwrite
        the one in <tt>src/bin/linux-386-glibc</tt> that our Makefile is using.</p>
      <p><i>Note: The website at the above link, http://www.lincom-asg.com/~rjamison/byacc/,
        seems to have disappeared. If you know where it may have gone to, or know
        how to contact Bob Jamison, please let me know. In the meantime, starting
        with the 0.8.10delta4 release, the sources to byaccj are bundled with
        the E sources, and byaccj is made as part of making E. </i></p>
      <h3>Zip Files</h3>
      <p>Our build process packs up the <tt>*.zip</tt> files in the distribution
        by using <a href="ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/">Info-Zip</a>'s
        highy portable, and highly ported, <tt>zip</tt> program. Info-Zip's
        zipping tools are open-sourced with a license that seems to resemble the
        X11 license, but before redistributing it, you should read it for yourself.
        The <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> distributions do not
        bundle in these tools.</p>
