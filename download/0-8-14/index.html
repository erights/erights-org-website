      <h1><a name="platforms"></a>Download by Platforms &amp; Versions</h1>
      <p>Earlier versions of <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> have
        been tested and run on MSWindows (95, 98 FE, NT, 2K), Linux, and now Mac
        OS X (which I think is really a FreeBSD platform). It <i>should</i> run
        on other UNIX platforms as well, given an adequate version of Java and
        bash (see below). It should also run without problems on MSWindows 98
        SE and on ME, but as far as we are aware, no one has tried this. If you
        experience any problems, or have any other informative experiences, please
        let me know, or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&amp;group_id=75274&amp;atid=551529">report
        a bug</a>.</p>
      <p> The <i>Installing</i> links below describe how to install, and run various
        forms of the binary distribution. The <i>Building</i> links describe how
        to build E from the source release. The <i>Download</i> links will download

      <h1><a name="Highlights"></a>Highlights of this Version</h1>
      <h3><a name="emacsmode"></a>Improved emacs mode for E</h3>
      <p>In the source distributions, the file <tt>e/src/elisp/e-mode.el</tt>
        is an emacs mode for <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>, originally
        written by Will Glozer (thanks!), and now improved by Darius Bacon (thanks!)
        and MarkM.</p>
      <h3><a name="capdeskicon"></a>CapDesk Icon and Shortcut</h3>
      <p>CapDesk now has its own icon, <img src="../../images/cap-desk.gif" width="32" height="32" align="absmiddle">,originally
        contributed by Ka Ping Yee (thanks!) to the <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        project for other uses. On Windows, capDesk.e now has its own shortcut
        using this icon. Unfortunately, in reducing it to 32x32 and making it
        suitable for use against various backgrounds, I (MarkM) think I ruined
        it, so consider the current appearance of this icon a placeholder until
        someone with a working right hemisphere fixes it.</p>
      <p>If no one objects, I'm thinking of retiring the old <img src="../../images/e-lambda.gif" width="32" height="32" align="absmiddle">(e)
        shortcut for the &quot;<tt>e --interact</tt>&quot; command. This command
        is useful from a shell, but someone launching <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        by clicking on a shortcut would probably always click on<img src="../../images/carrot.gif" width="32" height="32" align="absmiddle">(elmer)
        rather than <img src="../../images/e-lambda.gif" width="32" height="32" align="absmiddle">.
        If this isn't true and you want this shortcut to stick around, please
        let me know now.</p>
      <h3><a name="manual"></a>Simpler Manual Installation</h3>
      <p>I have gotten many complaints about the tediousness of the manual install
        procedure, because of the large number of properties in eprops.txt that
        need to be set to their default value. As the new eprops-template.txt
        (the file to be copied and edited into eprops.txt) say:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre># NEW (as of 0.8.14b): To ease manual installation, some of the
# entries in the eprops-template.txt file list the default value as
# their value rather than a dollar-double-curly form.  After copying
# eprops-template.txt to eprops.txt, you don't need to edit these, but
# you may.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thanks to everyone who complained about the way it used to be (too numerous
        to enumerate). </p>
      <p>Thanks also to Ben Laurie for an improvement to e-template.txt (documented
        there) that makes it easier to install as well.</p>
      <h3><tt><a name="extends"></a>Class</tt> and <tt>delegate</tt> are
        deprecated. Long live <tt>extends</tt>!</h3>
      <p>Everyone has now had their chance to comment about the proposal by Dean
        Tribble (thanks!) documented by MarcS <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/walnutObjects.htm">here</a>,
        to add the <tt>extends</tt> keyword and construct to the language
        as a replacement both for <tt>delegate</tt> and <tt>class</tt>.
        Since no one has complained, and the proposal seems clearly good to me,
        as of 0.8.14b <tt>extends</tt> is now accepted as an official part
        of the language, and <tt>class</tt> and <tt>delegate</tt> are
        now officially deprecated. In this release, all three work by default,
        but are controlled by three separate props, <tt>e.enable.sub-object</tt>
        (for <tt>extends</tt>), <tt>e.enable.delegate-clause</tt>, and
        <tt>e.enable.class-expr</tt>, as documented in the new <a href="eprops.txt">eprops.txt</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="printon"></a>Better Miranda printOn and <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        Stack Traces </h3>
      <p>Thanks to complaints by Dean Tribble, and leveraging our recent implementation
        of fully qualified names for <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        object definitions, <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>'s Miranda
        <tt>printOn</tt> method now prints starting at the last &quot;significant&quot;
        part of the object's fully qualified name. A &quot;significant&quot; name
        is anything other that &quot;<tt>self</tt>&quot; and that doesn't
        start with a digit. Start with a digit? A Java anonymous class and an
        <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> anonymous object both get
        local names which are numbers. The new rule seems to be a good balance
        between readability and brevity. In particular, it makes the stack traces
        spit out by <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> programs using
        anonymous functions and &quot;<tt>self</tt>&quot; much more useful.
        Why &quot;<tt>self</tt>&quot;? In Dean's pattern for using the new
        <tt>extends</tt> keyword for inheritance, one defines the concrete
        base object &quot;<tt>self</tt>&quot;. I'll let Dean explain why.</p>
      <h3><a name="listenaddrpath"></a>Listening on many ears</h3>
      <p>This release integrates in changes from Chris Hibbert (thanks!) so that
        you can now instruct a vat to listen on multiple TCP/IP ports. You can
        do this using the API of NetConfig prior to going on the air, or using
        the properties as explained in the new <a href="eprops.txt">eprops.txt</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre># e.ListenAddressPath is the optional TCP/IP addresses at which this
# vat should create the sockets it listens to.  For each element, if
# an IP address isn't given, the socket defaults to listening on all
# IP addresses of this host.  If an IP address is given, it must be
# one of the IP addresses of this host.  If the TCP port isn't given,
# it defaults to 0.  A TCP port of 0 instructs the OS to pick any free
# TCP port.

# e.ListenAddressPath=

# e.ListenAddress is deprecated. If provided, this address is added
# to the end of e.ListenAddressPath

# e.ListenAddress=</pre>
      </blockquote>
      I'll let Chris or Dean explain the need that motivated this feature.
      <h3><a name="newguards"></a>The Changing of the Guards</h3>
      <p>In the thread rooted <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-August/005593.html">here</a>,
        Terry Stanley proposes a set of naming conventions for naming variables,
        functions, and objects. These conventions have evolved some since then
        (eg, &quot;<tt>Pass</tt>&quot; has become &quot;<tt>Rcvr</tt>&quot;),
        but we have essentially been following the practices recommended there,
        with mixed results.</p>
      <p>There has been a live controversy raging privately without resolution
        that we should now make public. Should we be encoding near (supports immediate
        calls) <i>vs</i> vow (successful resolution supports immediate calls)
        <i>vs</i> rcvr (just do eventual sends) in the names (as this thread recommends,
        and as we've been mostly doing since then), or should we instead, or in
        addition, be using our guard annotations to express these distinctions;
        as Terry now advocates (thanks!).</p>
      <p>Whatever the resolution of this controversy, it seems like a good idea
        to be able to express these distinctions with guard annotations. This
        would be especially true if these guards could enforce the property they
        state, as with other guards. Unfortunately, for the new &quot;:vow&quot;
        and &quot;:rcvr&quot; guards, we can't enforce these properties at a reasonable
        cost until we have good support for PassByCopy, so these guards are just
        advisory for now. Nevertheless, as a way to capture programmer intent
        in a machine understandable form, this seems worth doing anyway. The relevant
        guards are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><tt>:near</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) A
            near reference passes this guard. All others get rejected. A near
            reference supports immediate calls on the object it designates. This
            guard is properly enforced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><tt>:pbc</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) A near
            reference to a PassByConstruction object. All PassByCopy objects are
            also PassByConstruction. When a pbc is passed as an argument, the
            value as received by the callee will be pbc. An unresolved reference
            to a pbc will successfully resolve only to a pbc, never to a far reference.
            This guard is properly enforced. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><tt>:vow</tt> and <tt>:vow(valueGuard)</tt> - (New as of
            0.8.14.) A vow may itself be a near, unresolved, or broken reference.
            If it's currently unresolved, then its fulfillment (its successful
            resolution) must be near. In other words, its resolution must be near
            or broken, but never far. A possibly unresolved reference to a pbc
            is a vow. A &quot;<tt>:vow(valueGuard)</tt>&quot; is a vow for
            something that will pass the argument <tt>valueGuard</tt>. For
            example, a &quot;<tt>:vow(integer)</tt>&quot; is a vow for an
            integer.</p>
          <p>This guard is currently not enforced -- it is currently operationally
            equivalent to &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; and is used purely for
            documentation purposes. Once it is enforced, it will send its argument
            <tt>valueGuard</tt> to the specimen's host to coerce the specimen
            there. If the specimen is remote, the <tt>valueGuard</tt> itself
            will have to be a pbc object. The &quot;<tt>:vow(valueGuard)</tt>&quot;
            will then return a promise for the result of (remotely) coercing the
            specimen by the <tt>valueGuard</tt>. This preserves pipelining
            (which a local check would lose), and prevents any messages from being
            delivered to a specimen that doesn't pass the <tt>valueGuard</tt>,
            but relies of the specimen's host to run the <tt>valueGuard</tt>
            honestly. If you want to trade pipelining for local enforcement, this
            is easy to write in the language, but seemed like the wrong default.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><tt>:rcvr</tt> and <tt>:rcvr(valueGuard)</tt> - (New as of
            0.8.14.) A rcvr is a reference that may be eventual, and whose resolution
            may be far. Therefore, one should only deal with rcvrs using eventual
            sends -- never by immediate calls. Without an argument guard, &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot;
            has the same operational meaning as &quot;:any&quot;, and so is properly
            if vacuously enforced. &quot;<tt>:rcvr(valueGuard)</tt>&quot;
            is a reference for an object that will pass the argument <tt>valueGuard</tt>.
            As with &quot;<tt>:vow(valueGuard)</tt>&quot;, this is currently
            unenforced, but will be enforced using the same technique documented
            above. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><tt>:any</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) The
            specimen can be any kind of reference, and no coercion is performed
            (ie, <tt>coerce</tt> returns its argument). This guard is properly
            if vacuously enforced. Though there is no operational difference between
            this and &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot;, there is a documentation
            difference, and a possible difference in static checking rules (see
            below). Whereas &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot; states that the declarer
            has special knowledge that he's warning his client of, &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot;
            is better used when the client may have better knowledge than the
            declarer. For example, a <tt>get/1</tt> from a <tt>ConstList</tt>
            would be declared as &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; rather than &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot;,
            since the declarer know that he's only handing back what was put in,
            which could be anything; whereas the client knows what he put in.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These annotations seem adequate for a lint-like static checking advisor.
        Here are some example rules that seem easy to automate. For concreteness,
        &quot;<tt>integer</tt>&quot; is used as an example of a pbc type,
        and a guard for such a type that does no coercion (either passes its argument
        through or complains), and &quot;counter&quot; is used as an example of
        a PassByProxy type and corresponding non-coercing guard. In the following
        &quot;&lt;=&quot; means &quot;subtype&quot; and &quot;=&gt;&quot; means
        &quot;produces&quot; or &quot;is of type&quot;. Note: I am not a type
        theory kind of guy, so advice and corrections would be especially welcome.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> near &lt;= vow &lt;= rcvr</li>
        <li>integer &lt;= vow(integer) &lt;= rcvr(integer)</li>
        <li>warn that rcvr(integer) should be vow(integer)</li>

        <li>Given counterRcvr :counter, warn of f4Rcvr &lt;- (counterRcvr), since
          it's probably bad, but is sometimes necessary and appropriate if the
          programmer has special knowledge these are both resolved references
          into the same remote vat. I doubt we should try to capture such special

      <p>A non-persistent <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> is called
        <i>time-local</i> since an object only exist as long as its hosting process
        does. A non-distributed <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        is called <i>space-local</i> if an object and all references to it only
        exist within its hosting process. </p>
      <p><font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> <i>by definition</i> provides
        distributed capability-security -- the ability for objects in mutually
        suspicious processes to safely cooperate. If it looks like <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        and it quacks like <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>, it
        might be a duck; but if it doesn't provide distributed capability security,
        it's not <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>. A system that's
        otherwise equivalent to <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>,
        but doesn't provide distributed capability security, is called <i>daffE</i>.
        A distributed <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> can only
        be implemented by means of strong crypto, of course, for which we are
        using code derived from the <a href="http://ai.cryptix.org/"> Cryptix</a>
        library (in accord with the terms of their open-source license). In a
        space-local system, no distributed insecurity can arise, so such a system
        would be an <font color="#009000"><i><b>sl-E</b></i></font> rather than
        an <i>sl-daffE</i>. </p>
      <p><font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> is designed to provide
        local capabillity-security -- the ability for mutually suspicious objects
        hosted by the same process to safely cooperate, and the use of capability
        discipline to determine which of its hosting process's authorities it
        may exercise. Such objects could be executing <i>untrusted code</i> --
        code that the hosting process (or its owner) doesn't need to fully trust.
      </p>
      <p><b>This is a &quot;complete&quot; release of E</b>. &quot;complete&quot;
        is in quotes, because both the persistence and the distribution leave
        much to be desired, as explained <a href="../0-8-10alpha/index.html">here</a>.
        However, these are close enough that this release that doesn't need qualifiers
        in its name.</p>

      <h3>Versions &amp; Types of Java</h3>
      <p>In refering to various versions of Java, we follow Sun's terminology
        and numbering. A Java Runtime, or <b>jre</b>, is adequate to run standard
        Java binary programs (class files &amp; resources). A Java Development
        Kit, or <b>jdk</b>, is adequate both to build a program from sources and
        to run it. A jdk is a superset of the corresponding jre, and their version
        numbers are always in synch. Each successive version of the jdk/jre from
        Sun effectively defines a new version of the Java &amp; JVM standards,
        except that Sun has introduced a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/java2.html">numbering
        inconsistency</a>: The Java/JVM 2.x standard corresponds to Sun's jdk/jre
        1.2.x. We ignore this inconsistency and refer to both as 1.2.x.</p>
      <p>This version of <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> requires
        a jre &gt;= 1.3.1. E no longer supports Java &lt; 1.3.1. To build <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        from sources, a corresponding jdk is required. </p>
      <p><i>Note: E does not install correctly when using JDK1.4beta on Windows2000
        -- it fails to exec with &quot;winfo.exe&quot; executable, used during
        install time to gather info about your Windows system. It seems to be
        a more general problem in execing executables. If you experience this
        problem, we suggest you install using a JDK1.3.*. Once installed, E should
        work fine with either JDK1.3.* or JDK1.4beta. <br>

      <h3><a name="bash"></a>Bash</h3>
      <p>To build E requires a bash available as &quot;<tt>/bin/bash</tt>&quot;.
        If bash is unavailable for your platform, it seems to work better than
        it should to make a symbolic link from &quot;<tt>/bin/bash</tt>&quot;
        to &quot;<tt>/bin/sh</tt>&quot;. If you try this and run into problems,
        please report these problems.</p>
      <p>To run the E driver script &quot;<tt>e</tt>&quot; requires a bash
        &gt;= 2.01 available as &quot;/bin/bash&quot;. The E driver script is
        required in order to be able to run E scripts (*.e files) directly as
        executables. To check your bash version, type</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>$ echo $BASH_VERSION</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>to your bash shell. A bash (2.05 as of this writing) for Mac OS X is
        available for <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_apps_utilities/bashthegnubourneagainshell.html">download</a>
        from <a href="http://www.savagetranscendental.com/tip3.html">Savage Transcendental
        Studios</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="build-dep"></a>Build-Only Dependencies</h2>
      <p>If you are only installing <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        from a binary distribution, or only rebuilding the Java portion for your
        own use, you can ignore this section. However, if you wish to build an
        <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> distribution from sources,
        then you will need the equivalent of the following tools as well.</p>
      <h3><a name="cygwin"></a>The <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/"><tt>Cygwin</tt></a>
        Distribution</h3>
      <p>The <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> building process relies
        on a number of UNIX tools. These are available for Windows from Cygnus
        Support as the Cygwin package. If you wish to build <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
        on Windows, you should <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html">download</a>
        and install a version &gt;= 1.0.</p>
      <h3><a name="byaccj"></a>BYacc/Java (Berkeley Yacc for Java)</h3>
      <p>The E source distribution contains the executable binary program byaccj.exe
        for Windows, and <tt>byaccj</tt> for Linux/386/glibc. These are actually
        <a href="http://troi.lincom-asg.com/%7Erjamison/byacc/">BYacc/Java</a>
        from Bob Jamison and <a href="http://troi.lincom-asg.com/%7Erjamison/byacc/ACKNOWLEDGEMEN">others</a>.
        BYacc/Java is the Berkeley Yacc program extended with a &quot;-j&quot;
        flag and others for producing Java output. BYacc/Java is covered by the
        Berkeley License. The sources to byaccj are bundled with the E sources,
        and byaccj is <i>optionally</i> made as part of making E. </p>
      <p>BYacc/Java is only needed if you wish to remake the parsers as part of
        making E. Usually, this is only necessary of you wish to edit the *.y
        files in the source tree (<tt>term.y</tt> and <tt>e.y</tt>). Since
        BYacc/Java is a C program, it was causing porting headaches, and most
        people interested in rebuilding E won't need to rebuild the parsers anyway.
        So as of this release we added a switch: If you set the environment variable
        &quot;<tt>MAKE_PARSERS</tt>&quot; to &quot;<tt>true</tt>&quot;
        before running &quot;<tt>make</tt>&quot;, then make will try to build
        BYacc/Java on your system, and then use it to rebuild the parsers. Otherwise,
        it will just use the parsers included in the source tree.</p>
      <h3><a name="zip"></a>Zip Files</h3>
      <p>Our build process packs up the <tt>*.zip</tt> files in the distribution
        by using <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/">Info-Zip</a>'s
        highy portable, and highly ported, <tt>zip</tt> program. Info-Zip's
        zipping tools are open-sourced with a license that seems to resemble the
        X11 license, but before redistributing it, you should read it for yourself.
        The <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font> distributions do not
        bundle in these tools.</p>
      <h3><a name="env"></a>Environment Variables</h3>
      <p>The following are the main environment variables controlling building,
        and normally the only ones you will need to be aware of if something goes
        wrong. Others variables are documented in the various makefiles, especially
        <tt>makerules.mk</tt>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>OSTYPE</tt></b> - To determine whether we are compiling
            on the Cygwin platform, we check whether this is set to either &quot;<tt>cygwin</tt>&quot;
            or &quot;<tt>cygwin32</tt>&quot; (both have been encountered).
            If so, we set <tt>CYGWINOS</tt> to &quot;<tt>1</tt>&quot;.
            All other conditionals test <tt>CYGWINOS</tt>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>CYGWINOS</tt></b> - See above. If you actually are on
            a Cygwin environment, but <tt>OSTYPE</tt> has yet a different
            value, you probably shouldn't change it for fear of screwing something
            else up. So just set <tt>CYGWINOS</tt> to &quot;<tt>1</tt>&quot;
            yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>JAVA_HOME</tt></b> - If set, it should be set to the directory
            where the JDK is installed. This is used to find certain executables
            and jar files that come with the JDK distribution. </p>
          <p>If not set, then the needed executables (eg, &quot;<tt>java</tt>&quot;)
            are assumed to be on the PATH, and the jar files directly known to
            the makefiles are assumed to be adequate for building. This is known
            to work when compiling with <tt>javac</tt>, and known not to work
            when compiling with <tt>jikes</tt> 1.15. See below.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>JAVAC</tt></b> - If set, should be set to executable for
            the Java compiler. The Java compiler is assumed to be command line
            compatible with <tt>javac</tt> or <tt>jikes</tt>. If the executable
            is on the PATH, then simple names (like &quot;<tt>javac</tt>&quot;)
            can be used rather than full pathnames. This can also include some
            initial compiler options to appear before the others. I normally build
            with JAVAC set to &quot;<tt>jikes&nbsp;+E&nbsp;+F</tt>&quot;.
            I'm using Jikes 1.15, and at least that version needs to be provided
            with the JDK's <tt>rt.jar</tt> file as an explicit component of
            the <tt>-classpath</tt> argument. The makefiles do this automatically
            if <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> is set to the JDK's install directory.</p>
          <p>If not set, this defaults to either &quot;<tt>javac</tt>&quot;
            or &quot;<tt>$(JAVA_HOME)/bin/javac</tt>&quot;, depending on whether
            <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> is set.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>JAVACMD</tt></b> - If set, should be set to an executable
            for running Java that's command-line compatible with the JDK's &quot;<tt>java</tt>&quot;
            executable. </p>
          <p>If not set, this defaults to either &quot;<tt>java</tt>&quot;
            or &quot;<tt>$(JAVA_HOME)/jre/bin/java</tt>&quot; depending on
            whether <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> is set. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><tt>JAVADOC</tt></b> - If set, should be set to an executable
            for generating Javadoc documentation that's command-line compatible
            with the JDK's &quot;<tt>javadoc</tt>&quot; executable. </p>
          <p>If not set, this defaults to either &quot;<tt>javadoc</tt>&quot;
            or &quot;<tt>$(JAVA_HOME)/bin/javadoc</tt>&quot; depending on
            whether <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> is set. </p>

          <p><b><tt>MAKE_PARSERS</tt></b> - <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
            contains a small number (two as of this writing) of *.y files, which
            are compiled into parsers written in Java using <a href="#byaccj">BYacc/Java</a>
            (see above). The generated parsers are included in the source distribution
            <i>as</i> sources, even though technically they are not, because most
            people interested in rebuilding <font color="#009000"><i><b>E</b></i></font>
            will not care to rebuild these parsers.</p>
          <p>Those that do wish to rebuild these parsers should set <tt>MAKE_PARSERS</tt>
            to &quot;<tt>true</tt>&quot;. This will cause the BYacc/Java executable,
            <tt>byaccj</tt>, to be rebuilt from sources, and will cause these
            parsers to be rebuild from their <tt>*.y</tt> files using <tt>byaccj</tt>.
            The BYacc/Java sources seem to have problems compiling on some platforms.
            If you encounter such problems, and especially if you figure out how
            to fix it, please let us know.</p>
          <p>If not set, this defaults to not rebuilding byaccj or the parsers,
            but just using the generated parsers included in the source distribution
            <i>as</i> sources.</p>

      If there are better or more conventional ways to control these building
      issues, please let us know.<!-- #EndEditable --></TD>
