            of this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include
            a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
            alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the

              Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered

              If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
              Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice
              in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would
              be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and
              to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
              to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
              only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
              or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
              warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered

              You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements

              if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
              the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including
              a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
              of Section <b>3.2</b>. The notice must be conspicuously included
              in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
              collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to
              the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
              Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
              from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the

              does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the

              You distribute the Executable version under a different license
              You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
              this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer

              You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other

              Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure

            subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to
            be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
            necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
            California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
            any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
            With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
            of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United
            States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
            relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
            property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,
            with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration
            relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
            under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating
            to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
            Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in
            Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
            for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable
            attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
            Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
            excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
