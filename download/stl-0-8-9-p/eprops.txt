# E Configuration File (or E Configuration Template File)
#
# If you are looking at eprops-template.txt, then
# you are looking at a template to be used to construct eprops.txt.
# In this case, for each property definition, you should instead see
# text of the form, for example,
#
#     e.version=$<<e.version>>
#
# but with curly brackets instead of angle brackets.
#
# In the comment preceding this line, you should be an example of a
# possible value of this property, such as "0.8.9".  Were this
# property to have this value in the eprops.txt file, it would appear
# as
#
#     e.version=0.8.9
#
# The eprops.txt file is written in a restricted form of Java's
# Properties file save/load syntax.  All these property definitions
# get loaded into an E process' System.properties.  If you are looking
# at an eprops.txt file, each property definition should have this
# form.
#
# Notice that there are no quotes around the value.  This is correct
# even if the property value contains spaces, since the Java property
# syntax reads all text till the end of the line.
#
# When a property value is a file or directory path name, it should be
# absolute and use forward slashes ("/"), regardless of the local
# platform's convention.  If it's a non-top-level directory, a
# terminal slash is optional.  Note: On MSWindows, you must specify
# drives the MSWindows/Java way ("c:...") rather than the Cygwin way
# ("//c/...").
#
# When a property value is a pathlist (a list of paths, sometimes also
# confusingly refered to as a "path", as in the PATH or CLASSPATH
# variables), then the entries should be separated by a semicolon
# (";"), independent of platform.  (As opposed to the Java convention,
# which is either ";" or ":" depending on platform.)
#
# The eprops.txt file should serve as a record of everywhere (outside
# of the install directory itself) that installation placed files, so
# that a future uninstaller will know (fingers crossed) what files to
# remove.

# What version of E is this?
#
# For example, "0.8.9".

e.version=0.8.9p


# Where is E installed?  If this file is eprops.txt (as opposed to
# eprops-template.txt) then this eprops.txt file should be in this
# directory.
#
# For example, "c:/Program Files/erights.org/"

e.home=/home/markm/ehome/


# What is the absolute path of the Java executable command?  This must
# be a Java compatible with Sun's JDK >= 1.2.  Though it's strongly
# prefered to use a Java compatible with JDK >= 1.3 or one important
# feature of E (Generic Deflectors) won't work.  Soon, E will no
# longer support Javas not compatible with >= 1.3.
#
# For example, "d:/jdk1.3/bin/java.exe"

# When E shortcuts are launched from the desktop, where should their
# current directory be?  Under *nix currently, this option does
# nothing.  On MSWindows, this option affects only newly generated
# shortcuts.  After changing this option, rerun the setupWindows.e
# command to generate new shortcuts.
#
# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/Desktop" or "".

e.launch.dir=/home/markm


# Where does trace data go?  This directory will accumulate
# debugging information provided by running E programs in order to
# facilitate a post-mortem analysis of problems.  The trace system
# treats the directory as a large circular buffer giving a finite
# window into the past in exchange for a finite memory burden.
#
# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/temp/etrace" or "".

TraceLog_dir=/home/markm/etrace



# Where are copies of the "e" bash script placed?  On MSWIndows, this
# option is only relevant to Cygwin users.  The "e" script should be
# placed somewhere on the PATH visible from a shell.  (On MSWindows,
# this means Cygwin shells, but not the MSDOS shell).
#
# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/;/home/markm/bin"

e.put.bash.pathlist=/home/markm/bin

# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/Desktop;c:/WINDOWS/Start Menu/Programs/erights.org".

# Which of .e, .emaker, .updoc, .vat, and .cap should be associated
