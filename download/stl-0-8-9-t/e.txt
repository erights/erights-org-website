# E Driver Script (or E Driver Script Template)
#
# If you are looking at "e-template.txt", then you are looking at a
# template to be used to construct "e".
# In this case, for some variable definitions, you should instead see
# text of the form, for example,
#
#     EHOME=$<<e.home>>
#
# but with curly brackets instead of angle brackets.
# 
# In the comment preceding this, you should see an example of a
# possible value of this property, such as
# "c:/Program Files/erights.org/".  Were this variable to have this
# value in the "e" file, it would appear as
#
#     EHOME=c:/Program Files/erights.org/
#
# All these variables come from eprops.txt.  See that file for more
# complete documentation.
