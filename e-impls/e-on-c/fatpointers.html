      <p>An object is <a href="../elib/capability/ode/ode-objects.html#lambda">classically
        considered</a> to be a combination of state and behavior, and this perspective
        is directly reflected in the Fat Pointer implementation technique. A Fat
        Pointer designates an E object, and is composed of two pointer-sized machine
        words rather than one. The first word is always the &quot;pointer-to-Script&quot;.
        The Script holds the various pointers-to-C-functions that constitute the
        E object's <i>behavior</i>. The second word is data to be interpreted
        according to the above Script. </p>
      <p>Fat Pointers can be seen as a unification of the &quot;tagged pointer&quot;
        technique common to dynamic symbolic language implementations, such as
        Lisps and Smalltalks, and the &quot;vtable&quot; (or &quot;class pointer&quot;)
        technique common to object languages with run-time polymorphism, such
        as Smalltalks and C++. In addition, Fat Pointers more directly accomodate
        multi-faceted objects, an essential programming style for capability-based
        computation. </p>
      <p>For a simple language implementation on the scale of ENative or Python,
        it isn't clear whether Fat Pointers are a net performance win. We haven't
        measured, but our best guess is that they cause code to run somewhat faster,
        but data to take more memory. Both effects should be less than a factor
        of two.</p>
      <p>
      <h1><a name="boxingData"></a>Boxed and Unboxed Data</h1>
      <p>When the data word holds the entirety of the E object's state information,
        we say the E object is <i>unboxed</i>. When the data word is interpreted
        as a pointer to the state information, we say the E object is <i>boxed</i>.
        Boxed state is typically heap-allocated.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For an object defined in the E language, the data word would be a
            pointer to a heap-allocated array of Fat Pointers for the <i>instance
            variables</i>. This array is the designated E object's <i>state</i>.
            In the ENative implementation, objects written in the E language are
            always boxed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For a primitive scalar object that fits in one machine word, like
            a <tt>boolean</tt> or a <tt>char</tt> (a Unicode character),
            the data word is the data, and the Script knows how to interpret that
            data. Such scalars are unboxed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For primitives that don't fit into a machine word (like <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s &quot;<tt>float64</tt>&quot;,
            a 64-bit IEEE double precision floating point number, assumed for
            now to correspond to C++'s &quot;<tt>double</tt>&quot;), primitive
            E Lists, or primitimes that are already heap allocated (like C's &quot;<tt>FILE
            *</tt>&quot;), the data word is a pointer to the state. Such primitives
            are boxed. Primitive E Lists of fixed-size scalars, will be implemented
            by pointing at a heap-allocated C++ array of this data type with no
            further fat-pointers or boxing. For example, an E ConstList of float64s
            would be designated by a pair of a Float64ConstListScript and a pointer
            to a heap-allocated C++ array of <tt>double</tt>.</p>
          <p>Because float64s are boxed, and E provides no smaller floating-point
            data type, floating point code written in E and run on ENative will
            perform abysmally. (Though note that Python also boxes floating point
            arithmetic, and people don't scream too much.) We hope that floating
            point code that needs to be high speed will typically be in the form
            of separable loops stepping over Lists of float64s. These could then
            be implemented manually as C++ native code running over C++ arrays
            of <tt>double</tt>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For Integers, since these are typically small enough to be unboxed,
            we split them into two cases. Assuming a 32-bit word, when the Integer
            can be represented as a 31-bit two's complement number, we designate
            the Integer using the SmallInteger Script paired with a data word
            holding the number directly. Otherwise, we pair the (not yet written)
            BigInteger Script with a pointer to the heap-allocated integer data,
            probably as an array of 32-bit words. We use only 31 bits of the unboxed
            representation, rather than the available 32 bits, since C++ gives
            us no portable way to access the carry or overflow bits. Rather, we
            check for overflow by seeing if the two most significant bits are
            different. <i>Where did this technique originate? I'd like to give
            credit where due.</i></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1><a name="historical"></a>Historical Analogs</h1>
      <p>In distinguishing between the kinds of scalars, and to distinguish whether
        something is scalar, the Fat Pointer technique clearly corresponds to
        traditional (Lisps, Smalltalks) tagged pointers. Instead of trying to
        squeeze a few extra bits into a single machine word, and masking them
        off to get the data, we use a full word each for the tag and the data.
        This allows the tag (the Script pointer) to distinguish among vastly more
        cases, and allows access to both tag and data without masking. Of course,
        the price we pay is that our pointers are twice as big. As we will see,
        this less than doubles total memory use. </p>
      <p>Object languages with run-time polymorphism (Smalltalk, C++) are normally
        implemented by a heap-allocated record holding both the instance variable
        <i>state</i> and a pointer to a data structure (vtable or class pointer)
        representing the shared <i>behavior</i> of all instances of the same class.
        Since our Fat Pointer's tag-equivalent is now a full word, it can point
        at this behavior directly, freeing the object's state record from doing
        so itself. In this analogy, the Script pointer acts like the vtable pointer.</p>
      <p>Without static type analysis, a conventional vtable-based implementation
        would always invoke an object by a double indirection: one to get to the
        object record, and one to get to the vtable. To an object's clients, the
        vtable is farther away than the data, but the client only ever invokes
        the vtable, leaving it to the behavior to deal with the data. The Fat
        Pointer technique saves us both the storage of the vtable pointer in the
        object record, and the extra indirection. Better, it saves us an indirection
        in the <a href="ground-rules.html#callSite">fast-path</a>, which is where
        it counts.</p>
      <p>On modern processors, it can be more informative to count expected cache-line
        faults than supposed memory accesses. If we can arrange for our Fat Pointers
        to be 64-bit aligned, then a single cache-line fault will bring both halves
        of a Fat Pointer into the data cache, whereas the vtable technique requires
        two faults for the same job. On the other hand, fewer Fat Pointers fit
        into a cache line, so the net effect is unclear.</p>
      <h1><a name="facets"></a>Facets and Fat Pointers</h1>
      <p>In E, when multiple object expressions appear in the same scope, the
        resulting objects share (subsets of) the same state, but each implements
        a different behavior using that state. In the <a href="../elib/capability/ode/ode-objects.html#facets"><tt>getter</tt>
        &amp; <tt>setter</tt> example</a>, the shared state is the variable
        named &quot;<tt>value</tt>&quot;. ENative implements this situation
        by having a single heap-allocated state-array per instantiation of such
        a composite, rather than a separate heap-allocated record per object.
        The Fat Pointer designating the <tt>getter</tt> object pairs the Script
        representing the <tt>getter</tt> behavior with the array representing
        this instantiation of the composite's state. Similarly, the Fat Pointer
        designating <tt>setter</tt> object pairs the <tt>setter</tt> Script
        with this same state. </p>
      <p>A vtable-based implementation would be unable to achieve this economy
        without resorting to complex techniques, such as that used by C++ multiple
        inheritance. (<i>Note: the Orbit compiler does this kind of aggregation,
        but it doesn't look ugly there</i>.) Without resorting to these techniques,
        a vtable-based implementation would place the vtable into the object-record
        rather than the pointer. To associate the same state with multiple vtables
        would require allocating multiple objects.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>By pairing different behavior with a common state, these two objects
        also provide differing authority over common state. In capability programming
        style, one often needs to define and hand out differing authority to common
        state.</p>
      <p>Remember that old adage, &quot;an object is a combination of state and
        behavior&quot;? Conventional object-oriented multiple-instatiation shows
        the flexibility of combining multiple states with same behavior. Facets
        show the flexibility of combining multiple behaviors with the same state.
        Our getter/setter is an example of a multiply-instatiated multiple-facet
        composite, and so does both in combination. Fat Pointers, by directly
        reflecting the truth of this adage, supports this implied flexibility
        of object programming in a simple and direct manner. At level of ambition
        of implementations this simple, they also support this flexibility is
        an efficient manner.</p>
