      <h1>EBoot, EEnvironment, startup, and all that</h1>
      <p> <b>Last updated:</b> [98/06/10 Chip] 
      <p> <i>This page was written by <i>Chip,</i> based on Arturo's excellent 
        <a href="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/neocosm/SubsystemDocTemplate.html"><i>template.</i></a> 
        </i> 
      <h2>Introduction </h2>
      <p> This document is an attempt to explain the E program startup process 
        in general and the startup of Microcosm in particular. 
      <h2>Requirements </h2>
      <p> The procedure for starting up an E application has to solve two problems. 
        First, it needs to get the E execution environment and run queue set up 
        prior to actually launching into the application per se, thus it needs 
        to insinuate itself in between the usual Java program launch interface 
        and the application. Second, it needs to establish the initial set of 
        capabilities and package them in a way suitable for being passed as parameters 
        to the highest level of the application, thus it needs to be in cahoots 
        with the whole mechanism for handling the E capability environment. 
      <h2>Architecture and Non-architecture</h2>
      <h4>EBoot, In Theory </h4>
      <p> A Java program is started up by giving the Java interpreter the name 
        of a startup class. The interpreter looks for a static main() method in 
        this class and calls it, passing it a single argument consisting of the 
        command line arguments stuffed into an array of strings. The startup of 
        an E program is similar, except that the startup class implements the 
        einterface ELaunchable, which declares a single method: 
      <pre>
<font size=2>public einterface ELaunchable {
    emethod go(EEnvironment env);
}</font>
</pre>
      <p> The go() emethod is passed the initial E execution environment (which 
        includes, among other things, the command line arguments). Note that whereas 
        in the case of starting a Java program the initial step is a call to a 
        static method on the startup class, in E the initial go() message is sent 
        to an instance of the startup class which the startup process creates. 
      <p> We get from the Java startup process to the E startup process via the 
        Java class EBoot. This class provides a one-size-fits-all Java main() 
        method that invokes the E startup procedure. The first Java command line 
        argument to EBoot is the name of the E startup eclass, with additional 
        command line parameters then following on in the traditional fashion. 
        EBoot in turn creates an instance of the specified E startup class and 
        sends it the go() message along with the initial E execution environment 
        which EBoot also creates. 
      <h4>EBoot, In Reality </h4>
      <p> The above simple and straightforward story represents the original architectural 
        intent. Naturally, the real story of what actually happens is way more 
        complicated. EBoot.main() actually just calls the static method callEMain() 
        on the class org.erights.e.elib.util.EThreadGroup, passing its own class 
        name (i.e., the string &quot;EBoot&quot;) and the command line arguments 
        array. EThreadGroup.callEMain() in turn creates new instances of EThreadGroup 
        (a subclass of Java's ThreadGroup class) and org.erights.e.elib.util.EMainThread 
        (a subclass of Java's Thread class). The EMainThread object constructor 
        takes three arguments: the newly created EThreadGroup (which it passes 
        to its super constructor), the name of the E boot class that was passed 
        to the EThreadGroup constructor, and the command line args array. It uses 
        CRAPI to extract a Method object for the method EMain() from the named 
        E boot class. EThreadGroup.callEMain() then launches the EMainThread thread 
        in the standard Java manner by calling its start() method. The start() 
        method calls EMainThread.run() which then uses CRAPI to invoke the remembered 
        EMain() Method, passing it the remembered args array. The EBoot.EMain() 
        method then does the actual work of initializing the E environment, instantiating 
        the E startup object, and sending the go() message to it. 
      <p> All of this indirection and fiddling around with CRAPI is so that (1) 
        the E run queue gets launched as its own special thread in its own special 
        thread group, and (2) there can be a choice of the actual boot class. 
        In addition to EBoot, there are several alternative boot classes, including 
        ELogin, e.quake.Revive, and IFCBoot. These all end up doing essentially 
        the same job as EBoot, except under different startup circumstances: 
      <ul>
        <li>EBoot -- vanilla E computation startup 
        <li>ELogin -- startup for Microcosm, does a bunch of extra initialization 
          work 
        <li>IFCBoot -- starts up IFC and then uses EBoot to actually start E computation 
        <li>Revive -- startup from checkpoint 
      </ul>
      <p> The actual work associated with starting up is done in the EMain() method. 
        In the case of EBoot it: 
      <ul>
        <li>Builds a Java Properties table, including parsing any property setting 
          arguments from the command line (and this parsing removes these from 
          the args array that the application will eventually see). 
        <li>Creates an instance of the startup class and verifies that it is indeed 
          an ELaunchable. 
        <li>Creates a new Vat for the E computation to take place in. 
        <li>Creates and initializes a new EEnvironment object, giving it the args 
          array, the Properties table, the Vat, and a reference to the system 
          class loader. 
        <li>Initializes timers, clocks, entropy collection, the tracing package 
          (if enabled), the Inspector (if enabled), the initial set of crew capabilities, 
          and the EStdio class. 
        <li>Sends the go() message to the startup object. 
      </ul>
      <p> The startup object which EMain() invokes is presumed to be fully trusted. 
        The EEnvironment object which is passed in the go() message contains all 
        the capabilities needed to be in total command of the Vat. It is the responsibility 
        of the startup object to hold these capabilities closely and to start 
        up the less privileged computation which will actually run the application. 
      <p> ELogin does essentially all the same work as EBoot, and then some. It 
        handles class preloading (if enabled), opening up the crew Repository, 
        starting up various timers that are used to collect performance statistics, 
        and invoking the login UI to get a user name and password. The ELogin 
        code is currently quite a bit more complicated than EBoot, in part because 
        it has a much larger quantity of diagnostic and tracing code than EBoot 
        and in part because it contains a number of performance enhancing tweaks 
        and JVM bug workarounds. It also contains thread handshaking in support 
        of the login UI, which, as a handcoded AWT thing, runs asynchronously. 
      <p> IFCBoot is really just a startup wrapper rather than an entirely different 
        boot model. It starts an IFC thread, waits for it to get going, and then 
        simply calls EBoot.EMain() directly. 
      <p> Revive handles the revival of an orthogonally persisted E computation. 
        It departs from the standard boot model entirely, the Revive class merely 
        serving to insinuate the restore-from-checkpoint operation into the standard 
        startup command sequence. Revive.EMain() processes the command line arguments 
        and properties in the standard fashion, starts up tracing and entropy 
        collection, then punts to another static method, Revive.doRevival(). This 
        doRevival() method is also called by code in ELogin when the latter detects 
        the presence of a checkpoint file during login (this code is actually 
        commented out at the moment, as a first step toward removing orthogonal 
        persistence support from the Microcosm application; however the scaffolding 
        remains in place). The doRevival() method restores the Vat from the checkpoint 
        file and sets it to running. No go() message is sent, of course, since 
        the computation in the checkpoint is presumed to already be started (else 
        it couldn't have gotten into the checkpoint in the first place). 
      <h4>Login </h4>
      <p> <i>Describe login here.</i> 
      <h4>Microcosm Startup </h4>
      <p> The canonical startup class (that is, the one that receives the go() 
        message) for our application is Agency. Nominally this is the class that 
        starts up the Pluribus runtime, but in reality it is the class that starts 
        up the Microcosm application (as a result of various unfortunate historical 
        twists of fate, these two components have gotten inextricably mixed up 
        with each other). 
      <p> Agency has two startup pathways, because it is both an ELaunchable and 
        a Seismologist. In the ELaunchable case it starts up via a go() message 
        from EBoot or equivalent. In the Seismologist case it starts up via a 
        noticeCommit() message from the Vat. In normal operation, the go() method 
        and the noticeCommit() method each simply send the Agency object an initialStartup() 
        message, which is where the two startup pathways merge. However, the go() 
        method actually has two startup modes, regulated by the makeTemplate property. 
        If makeTemplate is false (the normal case) it sends itself the initialStartup() 
        message. However, if makeTemplate is true, it immediately checkpoints 
        and then exits, leaving behind a template checkpoint file. 
      <p> Assuming the normal startup pathway, Agency eventually finds its way 
        to the initialStartup() method. This method performs some additional general-purpose 
        initialization steps, principally filling out the AgentInfo struct which 
        the Agency object holds onto: it summons the directory root maker and 
        the UI framework maker magic powers, creates an UnumMaster object, and 
        establishes a Registrar. It then looks for the Agent property and uses 
        this as the name of an Agent class which it creates and sends a go() message 
        of its own (the Agent go() message takes two parameters, the EEnvironemnt 
        and the AgentInfo). 
      <p> Although the choice of Agent class is parameterized via a property setting, 
        there is actually only one class which implements the Agent interface. 
        This is MicrocosmText. The MicrocosmText.go() method does some initialization 
        of its own: it does some state bundle loading, inits the Repository, hub 
        event log and member database, does a bunch of fiddling with timers and 
        tracing, then falls into MicrocosmText.initRealm(). This in turn extracts 
        the name of a realmText file from the property RealmTextFile and calls 
        MicrocosmText.createRealm() with this name as a parameter. If the soulTest 
        property is true and the checkpoint property names a checkpoint file, 
        then createRealm restores a state-bundled-persisted realm from the checkpoint 
        file. Otherwise, it reads the realmText file and creates a new realm from 
        scratch as described by the contained realmText. 
      <h2>Current implementation </h2>
      <p> As there is little architecture per se in this subsystem, the text above 
        describes the structure of the current implementation rather than the 
        plan it was supposed to conform to. 
      <h4>Is it Javadoc'ed? </h4>
      <p> Not surprisingly, given that this code spans a number of different packages 
        and classes written and maintained by a large number of different programmers, 
        the degree of Javadoc'ing varies considerably. Some of it is thoroughly 
        Javadoc'd, some not at all, and some has Javadoc comments that are present 
        but out of date. Cleanup is warranted. 
      <h2>Design Issues</h2>
      <h4>Open Issues </h4>
      <p> The current startup code is designed to support a degree of generality 
        that is not currently exploited. There is some question as to whether 
        this degree of generality ever will be exploited. In any case, the startup 
        pathway is extremely long and complicated, with initialization of various 
        components of the system happening at a variety of levels in the code. 
      <p> The present scheme has three levels of class parameterization: 
      <ol>
        <li>The boot class 
          <ul>
            <li>specified via the first command line argument 
            <li>controls E runtime startup 
            <li>vectored via JVM startup convention: internal class load followed 
              by static call to main(args) 
          </ul>
        <li>The startup class 
          <ul>
            <li>specified via the second command line argument 
            <li>controls Agency startup 
            <li>vectored via E message send: newInstance() call followed by send 
              of go(env) 
          </ul>
        <li>The agent class 
          <ul>
            <li>specified via the &quot;Agent&quot; property 
            <li>controls application startup 
            <li>vectored via E message send: newInstance() call followed by send 
              of go(env,info) 
          </ul>
      </ol>
      <p> However, the choices are much more fixed than this pattern might suggest. 
        The boot class is really always ELogin or EBoot, the startup class is 
        always Agency, and the agent class is always MicrocosmText. Within the 
        space of these fixed choices, however, are a number of other startup variations 
        controlled by other means: 
      <p> ELogin and EBoot have to perform essentially the same sets of initialization, 
        but they do so with code that is sufficiently different between the two 
        classes that it is hard to see the points of commonality. In addition, 
        ELogin runs the account manager to take the user through the login dialog 
        -- but does so before the rest of the runtime environment is established 
        and so invokes some 5000 lines of custom UI code. The boot classes are 
        additionally complicated by the logic to funnel through a common body 
        of thread initialization code, which is in turn complicated by having 
        the boot methods be static (which thus entails fiddling around with CRAPI). 
      <p> Agency supports two different entry paths, depending on whether it is 
        started from the normal pattern or as a result of checkpoint recovery. 
        However, we are phasing out orthogonal persistence and so much of the 
        other code needed for the latter path to work has already been removed 
        or commented out. Furthermore, in its normal startup mode, Agency can 
        either startup the program or it can fork and hibernate -- additional 
        support for orthogonal persistence that is on its way out. 
      <p> MicrocosmText also has two startup paths. Depending on parameter settings, 
        it will either restore from a state bundle checkpoint or it will create 
        a new realm from a realmText file. And in any case having realmText processing 
        be embedded in the system startup process seems perverse at best. 
      <p> A number of other minor initializations are parameterized by property 
        settings. These conditionally enable or disable various subsystems, such 
        as the Inspector, tracing, logging, and so forth. We probably want to 
        retain this sort of control. However, different subsystems are regulated 
        at different levels in the multi-level model, with no particular rhyme 
        or reason as to why a particular subsystem is controlled from a particular 
        place. The same comment applies to initializations in general. Some systems 
        are initialized in more than one place, in some cases with complex conditional 
        logic to make sure the program doesn't step on its own toes (the Repository, 
        in particular, seems to be initialized in three different places, but 
        the three sets of initialzations are all very different), and in other 
        cases have their initialization partially on one place and partially in 
        another.. 
      <p> The overall organization of the startup process reflects the organic 
        history of this code rather than a coherent plan. By rationalizing some 
        of this and reducing the number of levels of indirection, it should be 
        possible to reduce the bulk of the code considerably, and to make it significantly 
        simpler, clearer, and easy to maintain. A significant refactoring of the 
        startup code is warranted.
