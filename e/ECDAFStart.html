      <h2>The Electric Communities Distributed Application Framework (ECDAF)</h2>
      <p> 
      <h1>Application Startup and Core System Services</h1>
      <p> <b>Last updated:</b> [98/07/17 Chip] 
      <p> <i>This page was written by <i>Chip.</i> <br>
        </i> 
      <p> This document describes ECDAF API for application startup and initial 
        access to core system services. <br>
      <p> 
      <h2>Basic Startup API</h2>
      <p> The basic API for application startup is very simple. However it is 
        highly configurable and it is in this configurability where most of the 
        details reside. 
      <p> An ECDAF application must provide a startup class which implements the 
        interface <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.ELaunchable</font>. 
        This interface consists of a single method: 
      <pre>
    public interface ELaunchable {
        void go(EEnvironment env);
    }
</pre>
      <p> In addition to implementing <font face="Courier">ELaunchable</font>, 
        the startup class must have a public, zero-argument constructor, so that 
        the boot code can create an instance of it by invoking the <font face="Courier">newInstance()</font> 
        method on the startup class's <font face="Courier">Class</font> object. 
      <p> The application is started with a command line of the form: 
      <pre>
    java org.erights.e.boot.Boot <i>startclass args... </i>
</pre>
      <p> where <i><font face="Courier">startclass</font></i> is the fully qualified 
        path name of your application startup class, and <i><font face="Courier">args...</font></i> 
        are any command line arguments that you wish to pass to the application 
        itself. 
      <p> The <font face="Courier">Boot</font> class parses the command line, 
        initializes the core system services, constructs the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font>, 
        creates an instance of your startup class, and then actually starts the 
        application by sending the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> to 
        the startup object in a <font face="Courier">go()</font> message. From 
        the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> object your application can 
        then obtain the command line arguments, the properties, and the root capabilities 
        for all the core system services (see <b>Core System Services</b> below). 
      <p> For example, you might create an application: 
      <pre>
    package com.fudco.cool;

    public class CoolApp implements ELaunchable {
        public void go(EEnvironment env) {
            <i>your stuff here...
</i>        }
    }
</pre>
      <p> and then you might start it with a command line something like: 
      <pre>
    java org.erights.e.boot.Boot com.fudco.cool.CoolApp <i>args...
</i>
</pre>
      <p> 
      <h2>Properties and Command Line Arguments</h2>
      <p> The application can obtain the command line arguments from the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font>. 
        Before being given to the application, however, the command line will 
        first be parsed for arguments which modify the property settings and any 
        such arguments will be removed from the arguments made available to the 
        application. The property settings are also available from the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font>, 
        but are indexed by keyword rather than by position on the command line. 
      <p> Property settings may come from property files or from the command line 
        directly. A properties file is simply a file with a series of lines of 
        the form: 
      <pre>
    <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>
</pre>
      <p> which is interpreted as setting the value of the property specified 
        by the keyword <i><font face="Courier">name</font></i> to the string <i><font face="Courier">value</font></i>. 
      <p> Prior to processing the command line itself, a set of default properties 
        files are read. Currently, ECDAF tries to read three default properties 
        files: &quot;<font face="Courier">/usr/local/lib/eprops/systemdefault</font>&quot;, 
        &quot;<font face="Courier">.eprops/default</font>&quot; (in the user's 
        home directory), and &quot;<font face="Courier">/eprops.txt</font>&quot;, 
        in that order. If any or all of these files are missing, the absence is 
        silently ignored. Furthermore, a startup command line argument of the 
        form: 
      <pre>
    -ECNoDefaults
</pre>
      <p> will suppress the reading of these default properties files entirely, 
        leaving only those properties which are explicitly derived from the command 
        line. 
      <p> A command line argument of the form: 
      <pre>
    -ECproperties <i>filename</i>
</pre>
      <p> will cause property settings to be read from the properties file named 
        by <i><font face="Courier">filename</font></i>. 
      <p> A command line argument of the form: 
      <pre>
    <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>
</pre>
      <p> will be interpreted as a direct property assignment. 
      <p> All these property settings are cumulative. That is, you can specify 
        any number of individual property settings and property files and they 
        will all be interpreted. Property settings are processed from left to 
        right and a later setting of a given property will replace an earlier 
        setting. 
      <p> Any command line arguments remaining, after the property setting arguments 
        are removed, are made available to the application in an args array. 
      <p> For example, if we started the sample application with a command line 
        like: 
      <pre>
    java org.erights.e.boot.Boot com.fudco.cool.CoolApp arg1 Checkpoint=D:\foobar.cpt arg2
</pre>
      <p> then the application would see the command line arguments &quot;<font face="Courier">arg1</font>&quot; 
        and &quot;<font face="Courier">arg2</font>&quot; and the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; 
        property would be set to &quot;<font face="Courier">D:\foobar.cpt</font>&quot;. 
        <br>
      <p> 
      <h2>Configurability</h2>
      <p> ECDAF applications may be configured from the environment by the selective 
        setting of properties.<br>
      <p> <b>Class preloading: &quot;StartupClassPreload&quot; and &quot;PreloadListFile&quot; 
        </b> 
      <p> Class preloading is a feature wherein the startup code forces the loading 
        of a collection of classes in order to (a) avoid having to wait for class 
        load later when it might be less convenient to have a delay, and (b) to 
        get some control over the in-memory placement of the classes (in terms 
        of ordering and memory packing) in hopes of improving virtual memory performance. 
        This is a semi-experimental feature, in that the benefits are somewhat 
        unclear and vary from case to case. However, the feature is available 
        if you wish to make use of it. 
      <p> Class preloading can be enabled by setting the &quot;StartupClassPreload&quot; 
        property. If the property is set to the value &quot;<font face="Courier">preload</font>&quot;, 
        the classes will be preloaded directly as part of the startup sequence. 
        If the property is set to the value &quot;<font face="Courier">background</font>&quot;, 
        the classes will be preloaded in a separate thread that will run concurrently 
        with the startup sequence. If the property is set to any other value or 
        if it is not set at all, no class preloading will be done. In either of 
        the cases where class preloading is enabled, the value of the property 
        &quot;PreloadList&quot; will be taken as the name of a file containing 
        a list of the classes to be preloaded. The format of this file is simple: 
        one line per class to be preloaded, each line containing one fully qualified 
        class name.<br>
      <p> <b>Short-circuiting entropy collection: &quot;DeveloperEntropy&quot; 
        </b> 
      <p> The normal startup sequence goes through various motions to collect 
        entropy with which to seed the cryptographic random number generator. 
        Unfortunately, this process takes a bit of time, which can be especially 
        annoying during program development when frequent restarts of the application 
        are common and the security value of good random numbers is small to non-existent. 
        As a development aid, the startup sequence provides a mechanism to short-circuit 
        this entropy collection by seeding from some fast but not-highly-unguessable 
        sources. 
      <p> The entropy collection short-circuit feature can be enabled by setting 
        the &quot;DeveloperEntropy&quot; property to &quot;<font face="Courier">true</font>&quot;. 
        Setting it to any other value or not setting it at all will disable this 
        feature.<br>
      <p> <b>Customizable login interface: &quot;LoginUIClass&quot;</b> 
      <p> Many applications, notably Microcosm, begin with a user login dialog, 
        to capture a user name and passphrase. Ideally this login should happen 
        as early in the startup process as possible so as to avoid making the 
        user wait for all the various initializations to complete. In addition, 
        the user passphrase can be used to secure the checkpoint file (see <b>Persistent 
        long-term state</b> below). The ECDAF startup procedure provides a hook 
        for the application to provide its own login dialog. 
      <p> A custom login dialog can be enabled by setting the property &quot;LoginUIClass&quot; 
        to the fully qualified class name of an application login dialog class. 
        Such a class must have a public, zero-argument constructor and must implement 
        the interface <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.login.LoginPresenter</font>. 
        If the &quot;LoginUIClass&quot; property is not set, no login dialog will 
        be invoked. Instead, the startup sequence will proceed with launching 
        the application. However, in the absence of a passphrase, the application 
        may be unable to run, or at least unable to restore from its checkpoint 
        file, so take care. 
      <p> If &quot;LoginUICLass&quot; <i>is</i> set, the startup code will create 
        an instance of the login dialog class and then call its <font face="Courier">login()</font> 
        method: 
      <pre>
    public interface LoginPresenter {
        public void login(org.erights.e.boot.login.LoginCompletionHandler completion,
                          org.erights.e.elib.util.ECProperties properties,
                          org.erights.e.boot.login.PassphraseVerifier verifier);
    }
</pre>
      <p> where <font face="Courier">completion</font> is a call-back object via 
        which the login dialog indicates the result of the login dialog, <font face="Courier">properties</font> 
        is the collection of properties which the startup code has collected (see 
        <b>Properties and Command Line Arguments</b> above); and <font face="Courier">verifier</font> 
        is a passphrase verifier which the login dialog can use to check a passphrase 
        against the checkpoint file. 
      <p> The login dialog may do whatever it wishes to capture the user identity 
        and passphrase (and whatever other information the application may be 
        interested in getting, for its own purposes, as part of login). The passphrase 
        verifier should be called if the application is concerned with using a 
        passphrase-protected checkpoint file. The passphrase verification interface, 
        <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.login.PassphraseVerifier</font>, 
        is quite simple: 
      <pre>
    public interface PassphraseVerifier {
        public boolean verify(String passphrase);
    }
</pre>
      <p> The <font face="Courier">verify</font> method will return true if and 
        only if the given passphrase matches the one associated with the current 
        checkpoint file (see below). 
      <p> The login dialog may also modify the property settings to alter the 
        application's behavior as it sees fit. In particular, it may set the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; 
        property to select the checkpoint file (say, on the basis of the user 
        name). Furthermore, it <i>must</i> set the &quot;Passphrase&quot; property 
        to indicate the checkpoint file passphrase, if there is one. 
      <p> When the login dialog is finished, it should call the login completion 
        handler's <font face="Courier">afterLogin()</font> method to inform the 
        startup code of the outcome. This interface, <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.login.LoginCompletionHandler</font>, 
        is also quite simple: 
      <pre>
    public interface LoginCompletionHandler {
        public void afterLogin(boolean success);
    }
</pre>
      <p> where <font face="Courier">success</font> indicates the success or failure 
        of the login. Success means that the application should proceed with the 
        rest of startup. Failure means that the startup code will immediately 
        exit.<br>
      <p> <b>User interface selection: &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot;</b> 
      <p> The ECDAF is agnostic about the application's user interface or user 
        interface framework. However, it does have a notion that the application 
        at least possesses some kind of user interface, so there is support for 
        this concept in the environment. In particular, we would like the user 
        interface to be configurable so that alternative UI implementations may 
        be selected in different contexts (for example, we often wish to select 
        a GUI for a client-side startup and a CLI for a server-side startup). 
      <p> The user interface framework is selected by setting the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot; 
        property to the fully qualified class name of a user interface framework 
        class. Such a class must have a public, zero-argument constructor and 
        must implement the interface org.erights.e.boot.UIFramework. If the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot; 
        property is not set, no UI framework will be established and the application 
        will be entirely on its own in the user interface department. 
      <p> If the &quot;UIFrameworkClass&quot; is set, the startup code will create 
        an instance of the UI framework class and then call its <font face="Courier">init()</font> 
        method: 
      <pre>
    public interface UIFramework {
        public void init(org.erights.e.boot.EEnvironment env);
    }
</pre>
      <p> where <font face="Courier">env</font> is the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> 
        that is established as part of the normal application startup. This is 
        the same <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> that is passed to the 
        application startup object in the <font face="Courier">go()</font> message. 
      <p> The UI framework object will itself be placed in the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> 
        where it will be accessible to the application startup class. <br>
      <p> <b>Persistent long-term state: &quot;Checkpoint&quot; and &quot;Passphrase&quot; 
        </b> 
      <p> The ECDAF supports a form of non-orthogonal persistence built around 
        the concept of a single checkpoint file which captures all the important 
        state of an application (where &quot;important&quot; is defined here as 
        being whatever the application considers worth saving plus the information 
        that ECDAF itself needs to save to keep working). The persistence mechanism 
        per se is accessed via the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> and 
        will be explained in more detail below. However, property settings control 
        the mechanism's general behavior. 
      <p> The persistence mechanism can be enabled by setting the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; 
        property to the name of a checkpoint file. This can name either an existing 
        checkpoint file somewhere on the computer or a checkpoint file that has 
        yet to be created. If the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; property is not set, 
        the execution of the application will be considered ephemeral and it will 
        not be able to save its state. 
      <p> If the checkpoint file does not exist at startup time, a new persistent 
        ECDAF process will be created, including a new <font face="Courier">VatIdentity</font> 
        and an empty <font face="Courier">Registrar</font> table, and the application's 
        state will be null. If the checkpoint file exists, it will be deserialized 
        to yield the previously saved application state, <font face="Courier">VatIdentity</font>, 
        and so on. 
      <p> The checkpoint file may be passphrase protected. If so, the file will 
        be saved in encrypted form using a passphrase to generated the encryption 
        key. The operation of restoring from this checkpoint file at application 
        startup time will then require this same passphrase in order to succeed 
        in decrypting the file. The passphrase for decrypting and encrypting the 
        checkpoint file may be specified by setting the &quot;Passphrase&quot; 
        property. If this property is not set or if it is set to the empty string 
        (<font face="Courier">&quot;&quot;</font>), the file will be saved in 
        unencrypted form. And if the passphrase is null, startup will only succeed 
        if directed to an unencrypted checkpoint file. 
      <p> Note that by setting the &quot;Checkpoint&quot; and &quot;Passphrase&quot; 
        properties while omitting to set the &quot;LoginUIClass&quot; property, 
        it is possibly to startup an ECDAF application non-interactively, even 
        if would normally have an interactive login.<br>
      <p> <b>Participation in the networked world: &quot;ListenAddress&quot; and 
        &quot;SearchPath&quot;</b> 
      <p> In order to be a fully functional networked application, it is generally 
        necessary not only to be able to communicate with other entities on the 
        net but to enable them to communicate with you. To this end, the data 
        communications subsystem needs two critical pieces of configuration information: 
        what address and port to listen for incoming connections on, and what 
        information to provide to others (for example, in SturdyRefs) to enable 
        them to locate the application's process in the future. 
      <p> The network address and port upon which to listen for incoming connections 
        is specified by setting the &quot;ListenAddress&quot; property. This property 
        should be set to a string of the form: 
      <pre>
    <i>domainname</i>:<i>portnumber</i>
</pre>
      <p> or simply 
      <pre>
    <i>domainname</i>
</pre>
      <p> where <i><font face="Courier">domainname</font></i> is the either an 
        Internet domain name or dotted-quad IP address; and <i><font face="Courier">portnumber</font></i> 
        is the (decimal integer) port number. If the port number is omitted, it 
        defaults to 0. If the &quot;ListenAddress&quot; property is not set at 
        all, it will default to the local host name, or &quot;<font face="Courier">localhost</font>&quot; 
        if the local host name cannot be determined. Confusingly, however, the 
        <i><font face="Courier">domainname</font></i> portion of the address will 
        be ignored for purposes of setting up data communications; the network 
        address being listened upon will always be that of the computer that the 
        application is running on (as it should be). For example, our sample application 
        might specify a listen address of: 
      <pre>
    coolserv.fudco.com:2347
</pre>
      <p> which would indicate that the domain name is &quot;<font face="Courier">coolserv.fudco.com</font>&quot; 
        and the port number is 2347. 
      <p> An ECDAF process is located in the network using a &quot;search path&quot;. 
        This is simply a list of network addresses which are tried in sequence 
        as either plausible candidates for the actual process host machine itself 
        or as the addresses of Process Location Servers (PLSs) which might know 
        the actual address. When an application starts up, it is given such a 
        search path that should be usable for finding itself. The <font face="Courier">Registrar</font> 
        that the startup process creates will use this search path in constructing 
        any <font face="Courier">SturdyRef</font>s which the application creates. 
        In addition, as part of startup, each of the elements in the search path 
        will be treated as the possible address of a PLS and the communications 
        subsystem will attempt to register the ECDAF process with each of them 
        (and, as long as the process continues to execute, will periodically refresh 
        these registrations so that they don't expire). 
      <p> The search path is specified by setting the &quot;SearchPath&quot; property. 
        The value of the &quot;SearchPath&quot; property should consist of one 
        or more network addresses in the form described above for the &quot;ListenAddress&quot; 
        property. Multiple addresses should be separated by semicolon (&quot;<font face="Courier">;</font>&quot;) 
        characters. Our example thus might have a search path something like: 
      <pre>
    coolserv.fudco.com:2347;pls.fudco.com;pls.communities.com
</pre>
      <p> which would first direct someone to a plausible address for the process 
        itself, then have them check with the FUDCO PLS and then the Communities.com 
        PLS. Upon startup the process would register itself with these two PLSs.<br>
      <p> 
      <h2>Core System Services</h2>
      <p> The final important function of the ECDAF startup code is to initialize 
        the core system services and make them available to the application. These 
        services are all encapsulated by the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> 
        object which is passed to the application in the <font face="Courier">go()</font> 
        message. All these services are then usable either directly via methods 
        on the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> object itself or via capabilities 
        which can be obtained from the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> 
        object.<br>
      <p> <b>Properties and command line arguments</b> 
      <p> The <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> provides access to the 
        command line arguments and the property settings. Command line arguments 
        are obtainable via the method: 
      <pre>
    String[] args();
</pre>
      <p> which returns the arguments in an array. If there were no command line 
        arguments the result will be a 0 element array. 
      <p> Access to the properties is via a set of methods which echo the read-only 
        portion of the <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.elib.util.ECProperties</font> 
        method protocol. That is, entities with access to the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> 
        can interrogate the property settings but may not modify them. The methods 
        available are: 
      <pre>
    String getProperty(String key);
    String getProperty(String key, String defaultValue);
    int intProperty(String key, int defaultValue);
    boolean testProperty(String key);
    Enumeration propertyNames();
</pre>
      <p> see the Javadoc for <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.elib.util.ECProperties</font> 
        for full descriptions of these.<br>
      <p> <b>Persistence</b> 
      <p> The <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font> provides access to the 
        persistent data storage mechanism. In addition to the information which 
        ECDAF saves for its own use, the application may specify an arbitrary 
        Serializable object of its own which is to be saved. This object should 
        be the root of a reference graph of objects which encompasses all state 
        that the application cares to have persisted. The method: 
      <pre>
    void setApplicationStateBundle(Serializable bundle);
</pre>
      <p> specifies the object which is to fill this role (i.e., be saved when 
        the application persists), while the method: 
      <pre>
    Serializable applicationStateBundle();
</pre>
      <p> returns the object which is currently in this role. Upon application 
        startup, this can be interrogated to determine if the startup is a restore 
        from checkpoint. If <font face="Courier">applicationStateBundle()</font> 
        returns null, then either this is a freshly minted ECDAF process or the 
        process persisted with no application-relevant state (which is functionally 
        the same thing from the application's point of view). 
      <p> The methods: 
      <pre>
    void commit();
    void commit(StableStoreWatcher watcher);
</pre>
      <p> cause the current state of the ECDAF process (including the application 
        state bundle if there is one) to be serialized to the checkpoint file. 
        The second form of the method allows you to specify an object which will 
        be asynchronously notified when the checkpoint completes (see the Javadoc 
        for <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.persist.StableStoreWatcher</font> 
        for details). 
      <p> As discussed above under <b>Persistent long-term state</b>, the checkpoint 
        file can be protected with a passphrase. The method: 
      <pre>
    String passphrase();
</pre>
      <p> returns the passphrase currently being used, while the method: 
      <pre>
    void setPassphrase(String passphrase);
</pre>
      <p> changes the passphrase, including rewriting the checkpoint file with 
        the new encryption key.<br>
      <p> <b>Core Service capabilities</b> 
      <p> The ECDAF sets up a variety of services that are accessed by capabilities 
        available from the <font face="Courier">EEnvironment</font>. The methods: 
      <pre>
    DirectoryRootMaker directoryRootMaker();
    CapTPMgr proxyManager();
    Registrar registrar();
    UIFramework uiFramework();
</pre>
      <p> return these various capabilities: the capability-oriented file system 
        root, the proxy manager (which is actually the main capability to the 
        communications subsystem), the Registrar and the user interface framework. 
        Consult the Javadoc for the various classes (<font face="Courier">org.erights.e.extern.file.DirectoryRootMaker</font>, 
        <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.net.proxy.CapTPMgr</font>, <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.net.proxy.Registrar</font>, 
        and <font face="Courier">org.erights.e.boot.UIFramework</font>) for more 
        detail on these capabilities and their use.<br>
