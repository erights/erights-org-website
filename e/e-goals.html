      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p align="CENTER"></p>
      <p>The E language is designed to start as a scripting / rapid prototyping
        / command language, sacrificing performance and support for programming
        in-the-large (like static type checking) in exchange for simplicity and
        ease of use. Not sacrificed even a smidgen is security. Like Original-E,
        E is a capability-secure persistent distributed pure-object language (it
        inherits most of these features from our ELib platform).</p>
      <p>As a simple one-at-a-time command language, The E language is quickly
        learnable by non-programmers. As a programming language, E is immediately
        accessible to programmers schooled in C-tradition languages: <i>C, C++,
        Java, Python, Perl, Tcl, csh</i>. It should also be accessible to (fingers
        crossed) Visual Basic programmers. Speaking loosely, Python is to C++
        as E is to Java.</p>
      <h2>Intended Uses at Communities.com:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Internal poking</b>. The difference between the Smalltalk / Lisp
          / scripting language experience and the C / C++ / Java experience is
          striking. In the former, &quot;what would happen if?&quot; questions
          are answered interactively during that moment of curiosity. This supports
          learning and debugging. (This difference is often thought to be associated
          with compiled vs interpreted languages, but this is mistaken, as Smalltalk
          is as fully compiled as C, and until recently Java was only interpreted.)
          <p>E can already invoke any public method of any Java object. Once E
            is available, I expect most of us will keep a live E read-eval-print
            loop at our side while programming.</p>
          <p>
        <li><b>Internal Testing</b>. E should be a good language for writing replayable
          test scripts. Initially for unit testing of internal programming abstractions.
          Once also made a scripting language for Microcosm, we should be able
          to easily write replayable scripts of user actions. Which brings us
          to:
          <p>
        <li><b>A Microcosm Command Language</b>. E's message dispatch mechanism
          is designed to also include calculated verbs, such as appear on our
          pop-up menus. Once this interfacing is done and scoping issues have
          been figured out, E is intended to replace our current command line
          interface.
          <p>
        <li><b>A Secure Hub Administration Language</b>. This was actually the
          motivating case for creating the language.
          <p>
        <li><b>User Creation / Extension of World-Object Behaviors</b>. This could
          range from simply adding new World-Object verbs defined in terms of
          existing ones, to piecemeal programming interactions like Hypercard's
          ability to &quot;dive into&quot; a button and edit its script. MOO experiences
          show this to be a compelling source of richness of the world. See <a href="e-world-scripting.html">E
          World Scripting Examples</a>.
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Long term, assuming it can eventually be compiled as well as Scheme (as
        it was designed to be), E could give us a migration path away from Java.
        E is sort of Original-E without the Java (which ironically is different
        from Joule, even though Original-E is sort of Joule + Java). We have already
        spent at least ten times as much effort working around flaws in Java as
        it takes to invent, build, and support a good simple programming language
        (like Scheme, Joule, or E). So much for saving effort by leveraging a
        supported platform!</p>
      <p>Oh yeah,</p>
