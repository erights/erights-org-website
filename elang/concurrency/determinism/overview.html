      <p ALIGN="left"><i>This page represents speculative future plans for <b><font color="#009000"><i>E</i></font></b>.
        The features it describes are not currently supported. Until they are

      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="models"></a>Models of Computation</h1>
      <P ALIGN="left">The Turing and Von Neumann models of computation are strictly
        deterministic (as is that other Von Neumann model, cellular automata).
        In all of these systems, given the initial state of a computation and
        the specification of the machine it ran on, one can necessarily deterministically
        replay the computation.
      <p>Of course, this is true only because these models idealize-away many
        of the messy issues that plague real computation. Actors are an alternative
        foundational model of computation that idealizes-in many of the issues
        that these systems idealize-away. (Though the reverse is also true.)</p>
      <p>The first such issue, explored by many besides Actors, is the contrast
        of &quot;transformational&quot; vs &quot;reactive&quot; computation. A
        compiler is <i>transformational</i>: all its inputs exist before it begins,
        it runs deterministically producing output, and terminates. A compiler
        that doesn't terminate is buggy. </p>
      <p>A calculator is <i>reactive</i>: new inputs come in after it's started,
        these inputs effect both its state and its outputs. Its outputs may effect
        what further inputs it gets, so these outputs need to be transmitted before
        the calculator terminates. We do not require the calculator to terminate
        in order to be correct. Indeed, for a calculator, the opposite is true.
        Even though you can replay a calculator from a log of its inputs, you
        cannot model a calculator as something that computes from pre-existing
        inputs, since the inputs depend (via the external human) on previous outputs.</p>
      <p>Actors are inherently distributed and asynchronous, and so are pervasively
        non-deterministic. Actors successfully idealize all non-determinism as
        <i>arrival order non-determinism</i>: Messages race towards an actor from
        multiple asynchronous sources. As Einstein would insist, these messages
        had no prior determined intrinsic full order. Nevertheless, they are delivered
        to the recipient actor in some partially arbitrary fully serialized order.
        In order to replay an actor, you not only need the messages sent to it
        by the external world, you need to know how these races were resolved.</p>
      <h1>Loggable Non-Determinism</h1>
      <p>An <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> Vat is an Actor, and at Vat granularity, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> computation is Actor
        computation. Within a Vat we have approximately the singly threaded synchronous
        deterministic world of Von Neumann. It seems this is a good enough approximation
        that we could, under constrained but useful circumstances, arrange to
        segregate and log all the non-deterministic inputs to a Vat, or a subgraph
        of objects within a Vat, such that the remainder of the Vat's computation
        is deterministically replayable from these logged non-deterministic inputs.</p>
      <p> We call this property <i>loggable non-determinism</i> -- the ability
        to deny to a (possibly adversarial) subgraph of objects any unlogged sources
        of non-determinism. Ideally, such a subgraph should not be able to escape
        deterministic replay. </p>
      <p>Why would one want this property?</p>
      <h3> <a name="commitment"></a>1) Cheaper Commitment.</h3>
      <p>Databases often use this technique by writing a &quot;transaction log&quot;.
        Once a transaction request has been successfully logged, the transaction
        can be committed even though a crash may destroy its result state, given
        that the transaction can be deterministically reproduced from the logged
        request. I first saw this technique applied to committing general purpose
        computation by Rob Strom: Do a full checkpoint occasionally, and cheaply
        log inputs until you take the next checkpoint. </p>
      <p>It's not clear whether this wins over KeyKOS/EROS mmu-based checkpointing,
        since that's also incremental. But is sure beats the crap out of non-incremental
        checkpointing, which is the only reasonable alternative for those sitting
        above the jvm.</p>
      <p>( <a href="commitment.html">Read More...</a> )</p>
      <h3> <a name="fault-tolerance"></a>2) Cheaper Fault Tolerance.</h3>
      <p>This is really a variation of #1, where the understudy is separated in
        space rather than time. I first saw this technique applied by Auragen
        (which since disappeared), and since rather brilliantly by Rob Strom.</p>
      <p>( <a href="fault-tolerance.html">Read More...</a> )</p>
      <h3> <a name="inconfine"></a>3) Inward Bit Confinement. </h3>
      <p>Once we've plugged all means of communication accounted for by causality
        in our computational-model (or system-specification), all remaining ability
        to communicate must ride on informational inputs that are modelled as
        uncaused (&quot;spontaneous&quot;?). These are exactly the non-deterministic
        inputs to computation. In <a href="../../../elib/capability/confinement.html">the
        confinement scenario</a>, Alice generally isn't in a position to constrain
        Mallet (or verify that he is constrained), but she is in a position to
        constrain Bob (or verify that he is constrained).</p>
      <p>If she constrains Bob to be deterministic except for non-deterministic
        inputs that she believes Mallet cannot influence, then she knows that
        Bob cannot receive covert information from Mallet. Therefore, Bob cannot
        receive instructions from Mallet for making use of those powers given
        to him by Alice, but which Alice wishes Mallet not to exercise. Even though
        Bob wishes to use these powers to do Mallet's bidding, he cannot find
        out what that bidding is.</p>
      <p>( <a href="inward-bit.html">Read More...</a> )</p>
      <h3> <a name="debug"></a>4) Debugging. </h3>
      <p>When a compiler demonstrates a bug, since you presumably have the program
        which elicited the bug, you can reproduce it. Assuming your debugger doesn't
        effect computation as experienced by the compiler, you should be able,
        after the fact, to reproduce the bug under the debugger; even though it's
        later, the bug didn't happen under the debugger, and no extra cost was
        spent to instrument the compiler. This effect, normally taken for granted,
        shows the power of deterministic replay at its best.</p>
      <p>For non-deterministic computation, if we don't log non-deterministic
        inputs, we can't replay past computations. Such a non-deterministic program
        may drive us crazy with bugs that occasionally manifest themselves, but
        that we can never catch under the debugger, because it happens to take
        other paths then.</p>
      <p>If we are willing to pay the instrumentation costs to log these inputs,
        then we can deterministically replay the remainder of the computation
        under a debugger, and watch a previous bug occur under the scrutiny of
        the debugger. Unfortunately, these instrumentation costs can be large.
        Fortunately, tricks #1 (commit) or #2 (fault tolerance) would already
        have us pay these costs, because they're still cheaper than the alternative.</p>
      <p>For example, one can combine these techniques to build a server that
        is extremely resilient to its own bugs, and that really helps in finding
        these bugs. (We came up with this plan originally at EC, but never came
        close to implementing it.) The server process occasionally checkpoints,
        and also logs all non-deterministic inputs needed to replay it from one
        checkpoint to the next. It keeps at most three checkpoints on disk simultaneously.
        In order from oldest to youngest:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> a) the one committed to. </li>
        <li>b) the one being checked. </li>
        <li>c) the one being written out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>as well as the two log-sequences a..b and b..c. Unlike scenario #1, the
        log doesn't let us commit at finer granularity that a full checkpoint.
        Rather, while it typically allows us to recover (from a crash) at this
        fine granularity, our only real commitment is to checkpoint #a. Once #b
        is completely written out, it is read-in/revived in a checking process
        which asks all the objects which can to check their internal consistency.
        If all these objects say everything's cool, we commit to #b and throw
        away #a and a..b. If we're not cool, then we save away #a, a..b, and #b
        for debugging, crash the server, revive it from #a, and continue the service
        forward. </p>
      <p>This time, we hope that non-determinism will allow the live service to
        avoid hitting the bug again. We can even use our knowledge of where the
        non-determinism lies to ensure that other correct choices are made whenever
        possible, to make path divergence more likely. The very irreproducibility
        of non-deterministic bugs, that's normally such a liability to robustness,
        is potentially an asset for staying in operation while we figure out what's
        wrong.</p>
      <p>To do this figuring out, we've got #a, which reported itself to be consistent,
        or we wouldn't have committed to it. We've got #b, with a known inconsistency.
        And we have the a..b log, which should allow us to scrutinize the computation
        as it proceeds from an apparently consistent state to an inconsistent
        one. Given the <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> model that non-deterministic inputs only enter as discrete
        events on the event loop, and given enough spare cycles, one could even
        automatically isolate, with the self-consistency checking, the event at
        which inconsistency becomes evident. Only the execution of this individual
        event would then need to be stepped through manually in a debugger.</p>

      <h3> 5) Contract Verification.</h3>
      <p>This is a new discovery, and is the most interesting. <font color="#FF0000">***
        to be written</font></p>
      <p>( <a href="behavior-verify.html">Read More...</a> )</p>

      <h1>Hash Tables and Free Will</h1>
      <p> <font color="#FF0000">*** to be written. Some notes:</font></p>
      <p>I don't expect to do any of these immediately, but #3 (confinement) and
        #5 (contract verification) do become relevant in the near future. It turns
        out that #5 has a lot in common with #1 (checkpoint), #2 (fault tolerance),
        and #4 (debugging), but #3 (confinement) is curiously different. To do
        any of these, we need to do a good job identifying all the hidden sources
        of non-determinism. I thought I had, but recently hit a rude surprise:
        hash table enumeration order. Do KeyKOS and EROS also have this covert
        channel? (I think so.) Was this channel identified? Are it's dangers understood?</p>
      <p>To plug this, I came up with a scheme, refined by Ping, to make hash
        tables deterministic. It's cheap but it's not free. However, it does force
        a non-upwards compatible change to the determination of whether two ConstMaps
        are the same. In all other ways, the proposed hash tables are upwards
        compatible to the current ones. I look forward to writing this up.</p>
