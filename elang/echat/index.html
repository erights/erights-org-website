      <p>To demonstrate the power of E for building distributed secure software,
        we have built a simple chat system that allows two people to set up a
        secure conversation that cannot be penetrated or eavesdropped by any known
        technology. This entire chat system, written in E, takes only 5 pages
        if printed on paper, and as such is short enough to be discussed in detail.
      <p> The procedure for using Secure EChat is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li> Turn on your Secure EChat program.
        <li> Set the name by which you wish to be referred during this chat session
          <font color="#ff0000">(NOTE: Fix program so this is not required!)</font>
        <li> Log in to the Internet.
        <li> Offer yourself for a chat session by writing out a reference file.
          The reference file contains the URI of your EChat controller object,
          which is described in detail below, though as a user, you only need
          to give the program a file name and it will do the rest.
        <li> Email your reference file to the friend with whom you wish to chat
        <li> Your friend mimics most of these steps, turning on a copy of the
          Secure EChat program, <font color="#ff0000">sets their name,</font>
          logging into the Internet. But instead of offering themselves for chat
          by writing a reference file, they find you by reading your reference
          file.
        <li> The software sets up a secure connection and each of you can start
          sending the other messages.
      </ul>
      <p> The only step in this process that is vulnerable to outsiders is the
        step wherein you email the reference file to your friend. I.e., if a malicious
        third party intercepted the email, such a person could pick up the reference
        and present himself as your friend. This security hole can be easily closed
        by using a secure email system, for example by using the very easy to
        install PGP upgrade to Netscape Communicator <font color="#ff0000">***?</font>,
        Outlook Express, or Eudora.
      <p> Logging in to the Internet before creating your reference file is important
        only if you are using a conventional ISP connection to the Web, wherein
        your IP address is assigned by the ISP when you log in. If you have a
        preconfigured IP address, the sequencing is not important.
      <p> As explained in the discussion of capability-based security, the key
        architectural concept for maintaining security is to be careful about
        who gets a reference to an object in the first place, because if the trespasser
        cannot get a reference, he cannot breach your security. This architectural
        philosophy is employed in the way Secure EChat sets up a connection, wherein
        the only way for someone to find you is to get their hands on the reference
        document. By ensuring that only your friend can get the reference document,
        you ensure security (as long as the friend can be trusted; but if he cannot
        be trusted, no technique could give you security anyway).
      <p> The general strategy of only enabling a capability or eright when someone
        needs it and can be trusted with it is also found in the user interface
        of the Secure EChat program. Note that, until you have filled your name,
        all other buttons in the program are disabled. Similarly, the Send button
        is not enabled until a connection is in place. Although E can in principle
        allow the sending of messages to a friend who does not yet have a connection
        (by sending the message through the promise of a friend), in practice
        in the 2-person EChat program it makes little sense for the user to do
        so.
      <p> This technique of denying the user a capability until he can use it
        effectively is well understood by user interface designers and is quite
        commonly employed. One way of describing E's security architecture is
        to say that E rigorously employs this technique throughout every layer
        of software, down to the level where software meets hardware and acquires
        the ability, for example, to reset the system clock.
      <p> With that introduction, here is the source for Secure EChat:
      <p> <font color="#FF0000">This code is rather out of date, so to prevent 
        it from being updoc'ed, we start by exiting with success:</font> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">pragma</span>.syntax(&quot;<span class="litchars">0.8</span>&quot;)

<font color="#FF0000">? interp.exitAtTop()</font></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>First we set up abbreviations that allow us to easily access the parts 
        of the Java API most frequently used in the program, the Swing and AWT 
        packages: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><font class="comment"># set up imports
</font>? def swing := &lt;import:com.sun.java.swing.*&gt;
? def awt := &lt;import:java.awt.*&gt;

</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      <p> Next, we put the introducer on the air so our connection operations
        can come to life, and create a couple of utility routines that convert
        URIs to and from sturdy references:
      <blockquote>
        <pre>? introducer.onTheAir()


<font class="comment"># return the object represented by the URI
</font>? def getObjectFromURI(uri) :any {
&gt;     introducer.sturdyFromURI(uri).getRcvr()
&gt; }

? def makeURIFromObject(obj) :any {
&gt;     introducer.sturdyToURI(sturdyRef.temp(obj))
&gt; }
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p> More utility routines for reading and writing the reference document,
        opening the dialogs and putting them in usable form
      <blockquote>
        <pre><font class="comment"># return path to the friend file
</font>? def findFriendFileName(chatWin) :any {
&gt;     def theDialog := awt("FileDialog")(chatWin,"Select a Friend")
&gt;     theDialog.show()
&gt;     def path := theDialog.getFile()
&gt;     if (path != null) {
&gt;         path := theDialog.getDirectory() + path
&gt;     }
&gt;     return path
&gt; }

<font color="#ff0000" class="comment">replace with drag/drop the file?</font><font class="comment">
# return a pathName for a file to be saved
</font>? def requestSaveFileName(chatWin) :any {
&gt;     def theDialog := awt("FileDialog")(chatWin,
&gt;                                        "Save File with Your Name",
&gt;                                        awt("FileDialog").getSAVE())
&gt;     theDialog.show()
&gt;     def addressName := theDialog.getFile()
&gt;     if (addressName != null) {
&gt;         addressName := theDialog.getDirectory() + addressName
&gt;     }
&gt;     return addressName
&gt; }
<font color="#ff0000">
? def offerMyAddress(fileName, theURI) {</font>
<font color="#ff0000">&gt;     &lt;file&gt;[fileName].setText(theURI)</font>
<font color="#ff0000">&gt; }</font> </pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p> The set1LineComponentParameters is a utility for setting up buttons
        and textfields so they'll resize in an intelligent fashion when the user
        resizes the chat window.
      <blockquote>
        <pre>? def set1LineComponentParameters(theComponent) {
&gt;     theComponent setPreferredSize(awt("Dimension") new (150,25))
&gt;     theComponent setMaximumSize(awt("Dimension") new(1000,25))
&gt;     theComponent setAlignmentX(0.5)
&gt; } </pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p> The addComponent routine is a utility for dealing with a subtlety in
        E's interaction with Java objects: the Java Container class has many methods
        with the signature "add(object)", for which Java discriminates among the
        choices by looking at the type of the object. Since E is not strongly
        typed, it cannot make the same discrimination. Hence when using the add
        method for Containers, you have to revert to the primitive E method
        E.call(...). Here we encapsulate the usage of this low level E method for
        adding components to containers. <font color="#ff0000">XXX no longer true now that we have verb-string syntax</font>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>? def addComponent(container, component) {
&gt;     E.call(container, "add(Component)", [component])
&gt; }
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p> The first of the two big classes in EChat is the chatUI class, which
        constructs the chat window, its buttons, and the listener objects. Though
        there is a lot of code here, little of it is new; it is mostly just calls
        from E to the elements of Java's awt and swing classes needed to construct
        a window. The flow of control is essentially identical to the flow one
        would build in Java to achieve the same purpose. In some situations it
        could make sense to use a Java GUI builder to create the window code in
        Java itself, and then hook it up to E with <tt>import:</tt>. But since
        we wanted the chat window to be intelligently resizable, it was beyond
        the abilities of current Java GUI builders to provide it, and it turned
        out to be easier to construct such resizable windows in a directly-executable
        scripting language like E than in Java.
      <p> One element of chatUIMaker that is worth examining is the definition
        of myWindowListener. In Java, WindowListener is an interface that defines
        several methods to respond to different events. We are only interested
        in one event, the windowClosing event, so our windowListener simply uses
        a match _ {} statement to intercept and ignore all the messages other
        than windowClosing. A Java programmer would achieve a similar, though
        still larger and more complex effect, by creating a subclass of the WindowAdapter
        class and overriding the one method that interested him.
      <p> The other interesting feature of myWindowListener is that, after telling
        the chatController to leave (i.e., to terminate the conversation), it
        tells the interpreter to continue at top. This statement undoes the blockAtTop
        initiated as the last line of the program that keeps the interpreter from
        rushing off to the end of the program and terminating everything before
        things have hardly started; the strategy is identical to that introduced
        at the end of the (???) chapter.
      <p> The one important feature of the chatUIMaker for the other components
        of the program is the chatUI object constructed at the end of the chatUIMaker.
        This object gives outside objects (notably the chatController object)
        access to the widgets which it must manipulate (for example by enabling
        and disabling the buttons, and putting new messages into the chatTextArea).
        The chatUIMaker must receive a chatController so that the Listeners can
        send appropriate messages to the chatController when the user interacts
        with the window; this requirement for the chatUI to have a reference to
        the chatController imposes interesting design considerations on the chatControllerMaker,
        as described below.

      <p> The chatController contains all the interesting concurrency behavior.
        It is also the only object in Secure EChat that is exposed to another
        person's software, and as such, the only object that gives other people
        any erights inside your computer, and thus the only object that must be
        inspected in this system for security issues. We discuss the security
        issues of the Secure EChat program later. For now, let's look at the interesting
        architectural features. First, note that there are 2 definitions of chatController
        (<font color="#ff0000">note, get rid of inner and outer chatcontroller</font>),
        one enclosed at the end of the definition of the other. Why?
      <p> As you recall from the chatUI discussion, to compose a chatUI object,
        you first need a chatController. However, to compose a chatController,
        you first need a chatUI object (note that the first thing done in the
        chatController is the definition of a chatUI). This is a classic case
        of 2 objects needing references to each other essentially as soon as they
        come to life, a problem that has plagued programmers ever since the invention
        of the object. Here we use the E technique presented in chapter <font color="#ff0000">???
        </font>of immediately using a variable's name inside the scope of the
        code block that defines the object: the chatController being defined is
        passed to the chatUIMaker as the first step in the chatController's definition.
        And since the second definition of chatController is the last step in
        the definition of the first chatController, at the end of the definition,
        the first chatController effectively becomes the second chatController,
        and everything works out cleanly.
      <p> Interesting methods in the chatController include
      <ul>
        <li> <tt>offerSelf</tt>, which creates the file containing the chatController's
          URI. </li>
        <li><tt>findFriend</tt>, which creates a live reference to a friend
          based on a URI found in a file, and sets up the connection, </li>
        <li><tt>send</tt> and <tt>receive</tt>, which simply pass messages
          across and are indeed as simple as their job suggests--receive is just
          one line long, while send is long enough to both send the message to
          the friend and to post the message locally on the sender's chat window.
          All the effort to encrypt and decrypt these messages are performed invisibly
          by E for the programmer, it is simply and marvelously invisible. Here
          is the code:
          <pre>? def chatControllerMaker() {
&gt;     def outerChatController := {
&gt;         def chatUI := chatUIMaker(outerChatController)
&gt;         def myName := null
&gt;         def myFriend := null
&gt;         def myFriendName := null
&gt;         def myAddressFileName := null
&gt;         def showMessage(senderName, theMessage) {
&gt;             chatUI.getChatTextArea().append(senderName)
&gt;             chatUI.getChatTextArea().append(" says:\t")
&gt;             chatUI.getChatTextArea().append(theMessage + "\n")
&gt;         }
&gt;         def innerChatController {
&gt;             # transmitting functions
&gt;             to send() {
&gt;                 def nextMessage := chatUI getNextMessageBox getText
&gt;                 println("next message" + nextMessage)
&gt;                 myFriend &lt;- receive(nextMessage)
&gt;                 showMessage(myName,nextMessage)
&gt;             }
&gt;             to setMyName() {
&gt;                 myName := swing("JOptionPane").showInputDialog(
&gt;                         "Please give me your name for this chat session");
&gt;                 # myName := "marcs"
&gt;                 if (myName != null) {
&gt;                     chatUI.getNameButton().setLabel(myName)
&gt;                     chatUI.getNameButton().setEnabled(false)
&gt;                     chatUI.getFindFriendButton().setEnabled(true)
&gt;                     chatUI.getOfferChatButton().setEnabled(true)

      <p> The last part of the program is the lines that start up the entire world
        of EChat objects, and then block the interpreter from terminating before
        the user is done with the program:
      <blockquote>
        <pre>? def controller := chatControllerMaker()

? interp.blockAtTop()
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p> And that is the whole program.
      <p> <b>Security considerations</b>
      <p> As noted earlier, the total security analysis of Secure EChat boils
        down to an assessment of the appropriateness of the erights granted by
        the 10 public methods of the chatController. If these 10 methods grant
        only erights that are appropriate for the person at the other end of the
        conversation, even if your friend turns out to be less than trustworthy,
        little harm can come to you or your computer. But if, for example, there
        were methods in chatController to ReadADirectory and WriteAFile, your
        computer would be exposed to considerable danger, because a malicious
        chatter could destroy your hard disk, steal your company proprietary data,
        and install a virus that would watch for your password the next time you
        turned on your Quicken checkbook. (<font color="#ff0000">unless you were
        running Secure EChat on top of the SafeEMachine, described elsewhere,
        in which case a malicious access to these abilities would throw an alert
        out to the user)</font>.
      <p> How secure is this version of EChat? The answer is, probably secure
        enough for this application, but still not as secure as a purist might
        prefer. This chatController mixes 2 different sets of methods in its public
        interface: methods that must be public so the listeners in the chat window
        can call them, and methods that must be public so that the friend's chat
        program can call them. Let's look at a couple of things pernicious friends
        might do with a modified version of the Secure EChat program: they might
        issue a setMyName command to your computer, which would be irritating
        because it would pop up a dialog box on your computer, though beyond that
        the damage is negligible. Similarly friends could tell your program to
        offerSelf, again popping a dialog box. They could also make you send repeatedly,
        but this would only make you send whatever you had in your nextMessage
        text field, so again the harm is quite limited. Really, the worst harm
        such a &nbsp;"friend" could do is persuade you that the Secure EChat program
        itself was unreliable (because it would pop dialog boxes and send incomplete
        messages for no visible reason).
      <p> How difficult is it to fully secure this program, so that even a friend
        who was sent by Satan (or the Internal Revenue Service... is there a difference?)
        could not do anything except chat? The answer is, it takes ??? additional
        lines of code, and the modification of one existing line of code.
      <p> The solution is to create a chatReceiver object that acts as a facet
        for the chatController, passing through only those messages that the friend
        is allowed to send. The chatReceiver looks like this:
      <pre>def chatReceiverMaker new(chatController) {
    def chatReceiver {
        to receive(theMessage) {chatController.receive(theMessage)}
        to receiveFriend(theFriend) { chatController.receiveFriend(theFriend)}
        to receiveFriendName(theName) {chatController.receiveFriendName(theName) }
        to sendName {chatController.sendName() }
	to friendIsLeaving{chatController.friendIsLeaving()}
        match _ { }
    }
}
...
# (now inside the chatController definition)
def myChatReceiver := chatReceiverMaker(chatController)
</pre>
      <p> The parts of the chatController public interface that are strictly for
        local usage simply don't appear in the chatReceiver, so the friend's program
        has no access to them--as long as we send the friend a reference to the
        chatReceiver rather than the chatController, by replacing the reference
        to the chatController with a reference to the chatReceiver, in the following
        line of code from the chatController's offerSelf method:
      <pre># (inside of offerSelf)
offerMyAddress(myAddressFileName, makeURIFromObject(myChatReceiver))


</pre>
      <p> That's it! Secure EChat is now secure even from your friends who are
        in cahoots with the CIA! :-)
