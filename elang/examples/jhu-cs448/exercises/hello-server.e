# Once E is installed, launch hello-server.e in one shell, wait for it to 
# print "waiting...", and then launch hello-client.e in another shell on the 
# same machine.

# hello-server.e writes ~/Desktop/hello.cap, which hello-client.e reads. 
# Therefore, you must either already have a writable ~/Desktop, or you must 
# modify these files.

# Given two connected machines that can address each other (i.e., no NAT in 
# the middle), you can run hello-server.e on one, copy its 
# ~/Desktop/hello.cap to the ~/Desktop/hello.cap of the other, and then run 
# hello-client.e on the other. This file represents a password capability -- 
# without access to the unguessable knowledge it contains, no one else can 
# cause your hello-server to print "Hello world" to its stdout.

# Until your vat goes onTheAir, it can't send or receive objects from other
# vats.
