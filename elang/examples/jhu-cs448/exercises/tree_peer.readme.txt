To start supervisor, type:
  rune tree_sup.e

Then to initialize the tree, type:
  rune tree_peer.e NodeName

For example, a 7 node tree could be initialize as follows:

rune tree_peer.e A
rune tree_peer.e B
rune tree_peer.e C
rune tree_peer.e D
rune tree_peer.e E
rune tree_peer.e F
rune tree_peer.e G

Then, on a separate cigwin console, you may connect
to any of the nodes and start a broadcast/leave. The 
node file names end with assinged nave above.

introducer.onTheAir()
def uriA := <file:tree-peer-A.cap>.getText()
def pA := introducer.sturdyFromURI(uriA).getRcvr()
def uriC := <file:tree-peer-C.cap>.getText()
def pC := introducer.sturdyFromURI(uriC).getRcvr()

pA <- Broadcast("Johns", null)
pC <- Broadcast("Hopkins", null)
pC <- Leave()
pA <- Broadcast("University", null)
