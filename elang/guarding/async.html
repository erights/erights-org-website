      <h3><a name="newguards"></a>The Changing of the Guard</h3>
      <p>In the thread rooted <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-August/005593.html">here</a>, 
        Terry Stanley proposes a set of naming conventions for naming variables, 
        functions, and objects. These conventions have evolved some since then 
        (eg, &quot;<tt>Pass</tt>&quot; has become &quot;<tt>Rcvr</tt>&quot;), 
        but we have essentially been following the practices recommended there, 
        with mixed results.</p>
      <p>There has been a live controversy raging privately without resolution 
        that we should now make public. Should we be encoding near (supports immediate 
        calls) <i>vs</i> vow (successful resolution supports immediate calls) 
        <i>vs</i> rcvr (just do eventual sends) in the names (as this thread recommends, 
        and as we've been mostly doing since then), or should we instead, or in 
        addition, be using our guard annotations to express these distinctions; 
        as Terry now advocates (thanks!).</p>
      <p>Whatever the resolution of this controversy, it seems like a good idea 
        to be able to express these distinctions with guard annotations. This 
        would be especially true if these guards could enforce the property they 
        state, as with other guards. Unfortunately, for the new &quot;:vow&quot; 
        and &quot;:rcvr&quot; guards, we can't enforce these properties at a reasonable 
        cost until we have good support for PassByCopy, so these guards are just 
        advisory for now. Nevertheless, as a way to capture programmer intent 
        in a machine understandable form, this seems worth doing anyway. The relevant 
        guards are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p><tt>:near</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) A near 
            reference passes this guard. All others get rejected. A near reference 
            supports immediate calls on the object it designates. This guard is 
            properly enforced.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><tt>:pbc</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) A near 
            reference to a PassByConstruction object. All PassByCopy objects are 
            also PassByConstruction. When a pbc is passed as an argument, the 
            value as received by the callee will be pbc. An unresolved reference 
            to a pbc will successfully resolve only to a pbc, never to a far reference. 
            This guard is properly enforced. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><tt>:vow</tt> and <tt>:vow[valueGuard]</tt> - (New as of 0.8.14.) 
            A vow may itself be a near, unresolved, or broken reference. If it's 
            currently unresolved, then its fulfillment (its successful resolution) 
            must be near. In other words, its resolution must be near or broken, 
            but never far. A possibly unresolved reference to a pbc is a vow. 
            A &quot;<tt>:vow[valueGuard]</tt>&quot; is a vow for something that 
            will pass the argument <tt>valueGuard</tt>. For example, a &quot;<tt>:vow[int]</tt>&quot; 
            is a vow for an int.</p>
          <p>This guard is currently not enforced -- it is currently operationally 
            equivalent to &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; and is used purely for documentation 
            purposes. Once it is enforced, it will send its argument <tt>valueGuard</tt> 
            to the specimen's host to coerce the specimen there. If the specimen 
            is remote, the <tt>valueGuard</tt> itself will have to be a pbc object. 
            The &quot;<tt>:vow[valueGuard]</tt>&quot; will then return a promise 
            for the result of (remotely) coercing the specimen by the <tt>valueGuard</tt>. 
            This preserves pipelining (which a local check would lose), and prevents 
            any messages from being delivered to a specimen that doesn't pass 
            the <tt>valueGuard</tt>, but relies of the specimen's host to run 
            the <tt>valueGuard</tt> honestly. If you want to trade pipelining 
            for local enforcement, this is easy to write in the language, but 
            seemed like the wrong default.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><tt>:rcvr</tt> and <tt>:rcvr[valueGuard]</tt> - (New as of 0.8.14.) 
            A rcvr is a reference that may be eventual, and whose resolution may 
            be far. Therefore, one should only deal with rcvrs using eventual 
            sends -- never by immediate calls. Without an argument guard, &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot; 
            has the same operational meaning as &quot;:any&quot;, and so is properly 
            if vacuously enforced. &quot;<tt>:rcvr[valueGuard]</tt>&quot; is a 
            reference for an object that will pass the argument <tt>valueGuard</tt>. 
            As with &quot;<tt>:vow[valueGuard]</tt>&quot;, this is currently unenforced, 
            but will be enforced using the same technique documented above. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><tt>:any</tt> - (No change in meaning or implementation.) The specimen 
            can be any kind of reference, and no coercion is performed (ie, <tt>coerce</tt> 
            returns its argument). This guard is properly if vacuously enforced. 
            Though there is no operational difference between this and &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot;, 
            there is a documentation difference, and a possible difference in 
            static checking rules (see below). Whereas &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot; 
            states that the declarer has special knowledge that he's warning his 
            client of, &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; is better used when the client 
            may have better knowledge than the declarer. For example, a <tt>get/1</tt> 
            from a <tt>ConstList</tt> would be declared as &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; 
            rather than &quot;<tt>:rcvr</tt>&quot;, since the declarer know that 
            he's only handing back what was put in, which could be anything; whereas 
            the client knows what he put in.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These annotations seem adequate for a lint-like static checking advisor. 
        Here are some example rules that seem easy to automate. For concreteness, 
        &quot;<tt>int</tt>&quot; is used as an example of a pbc type, and a guard 
        for such a type that does no coercion (either passes its argument through 
        or complains), and &quot;Counter&quot; is used as an example of a PassByProxy 
        type and corresponding non-coercing guard. In the following &quot;&lt;=&quot; 
        means &quot;subtype&quot; and &quot;=&gt;&quot; means &quot;produces&quot; 
        or &quot;is of type&quot;. Note: I am not a type theory kind of guy, so 
        advice and corrections would be especially welcome. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> near &lt;= vow &lt;= rcvr</li>
        <li>int &lt;= vow[int]&lt;= rcvr[int]</li>
        <li>warn that rcvr[int] should be vow[int]</li>
        <li>Counter &lt;= vow[Counter]&lt;= rcvr[Counter]</li>
        <li>warn that vow[Counter] may want to be rcvr[Counter], though vow[Counter] 
          can be correct if you know that the counter is necessarily local.</li>
        <li>Given def f1():int, f1() =&gt; int, f1 &lt;- () =&gt; vow[int]</li>
        <li>Given def f2():vow, f2() =&gt; vow, f2 &lt;- () =&gt; vow (since f2 
          is a near reference to such a function)</li>
        <li>Given f2Rcvr :rcvr[F2], f2Rcvr &lt;- () =&gt; rcvr (since f2Rcvr may 
          be remote, and a vow to it may be a rcvr to us.)</li>
        <li>Given f1Rcvr :rcvr[F1], f1Rcvr &lt;- () =&gt; vow[int] (since a remote 
          reference to a vow for a pbc is still a vow for a pbc.)</li>
        <li>when (vow) -&gt; done(near) is ok</li>
        <li>when (vow[int]) -&gt; done(int) is ok</li>
        <li>when (rcvr) -&gt; done(rcvr) is ok</li>
        <li>Given def f3(int), f3(int) is ok, f3 &lt;- (int) is ok</li>
        <li>Given def f4(counter), f4(counter) is ok, f4 &lt;- (counter) is ok 
          (since both f3 and counter are near references.)</li>
        <li>Given f4Rcvr :rcvr[F4], f4Rcvr &lt;- (counter) is bad (since f4Rcvr 
          may be remote.)</li>
        <li>Given counter :Counter, warn of f4Rcvr &lt;- (counter), since it's 
          probably bad, but is sometimes necessary and appropriate if the programmer 
          has special knowledge these are both resolved references into the same 
          remote vat. I doubt we should try to capture such special knowledge 
          in static checking rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This list is intended to be more suggestive than correct or complete, 
        in the hopes that someone who has competency with such matters may take 
        it from here. Please let me know if you're interested, or start an argument 
        about these rules on the e-lang list.</p>
