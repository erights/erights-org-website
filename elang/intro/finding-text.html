      <hr> <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" --> In this tutorial, you are going to write
      an E program that finds occurrences of a specific text string in a file.
      You will need an example file to work with. Use a text editor to create
      a text file containing the following stanzas of the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;:
      <blockquote>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        All mimsy were the borogoves, <br>
        And the mome raths outgrabe.
        <p>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
          The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
          Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
          The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;
      </blockquote>
      <p>Save the text in a file called jabberwocky.txt in a directory on your
        file system called, for example, &quot;<tt>c:/jabbertest</tt>&quot;.
        Or, you can fetch it from the web at <a href="http://www.erights.org/elang/intro/jabberwocky.txt">http://www.erights.org/elang/intro/jabberwocky.txt</a>
        and save it in this directory. If your directory isn't &quot;<tt>c:/jabbertest</tt>&quot;,
        be sure to change the directory name in all the example code below. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can enter the following E code, to automatically copy
        jabberwocky.txt from the web into your file. (Don't worry if you don't
        understand this code yet. It's just here to set up the example.)</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">pragma</span>.syntax(&quot;<span class="litchars">0.8</span>&quot;)

? def poem := &lt;http://www.erights.org/elang/intro/jabberwocky.txt&gt;
# value: &lt;http://www.erights.org/elang/intro/jabberwocky.txt&gt;

? &lt;file:c:/jabbertest&gt;.mkdirs(null); null
? &lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;.setText(poem.getText())</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <h3> The for-loop</h3>
      A loop is used to run one or more expressions multiple times. The most common
      kind of loop is the for-loop. Type the following for-loop into <b><tt>elmer</tt></b>.
      <blockquote>
        <pre>? for line in &lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt; {
>     print(line)
> }</pre>
      </blockquote>
      After the first and second line, <b><tt>elmer</tt></b> knows it doesn't
      yet have a complete expression so it keeps prompting for more with the &quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot;.
      After typing the third line, elmer knows the for-loop expression is complete,
      and runs it. You should see the contents of the file jabberwocky.txt:
      <blockquote>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        All mimsy were the borogoves, <br>
        And the mome raths outgrabe.
        <p>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
          The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
          Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
          The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;
      </blockquote>
      For every line found in the file jabberwocky.txt, the for-loop prints the
      line to the display. It repeats this operation until it has read all the
      lines in the file.
      <h3> Functions</h3>
      The for-loop you have written is good for printing the file jabberwocky.txt,
      but suppose you want to print a different file? You would like to have the
      same code perform the same operation for any input you provide. A function
      does just that.
      <p>Add lines before and after the for-loop to change it to look like this:
      <pre>        ? def show(file) :void {
        >     for line in file {
        >         print(line)
        >     }
        > }
        # value: &lt;show>

        ? show(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;)</pre>
      As in the previous example, the contents of the file jabberwocky.txt are
      output in the Program window.
      <h4> Function definition</h4>
      The define-expression, which begins at the word <tt>def</tt> and ends
      at the last curly brace, }, defines a function called &quot;<tt>show</tt>&quot;.
      Executing the define-expression performs no action except creating a function
      that you can use later, defining a variable named &quot;show&quot;, and
      initializing this variable to hold this function as its initial value.
      <p>If you indeed edited the original for-loop in place to create the <tt>show</tt>
        function, be sure to hit <i>Enter</i> after the last closing curly brace,
        }, in order to cause the function to be defined. Of course, this rules
        applies to all the examples below as well. Until this last <i>Enter</i>,
        you are just editing text, but not effecting the E interpreter.
      <h4> Parameters</h4>
      The <tt>show</tt> function contains the for-loop operating on the variable
      <tt>file</tt>. The variable <tt>file</tt> is called the function's
      parameter. A parameter is a placeholder for data provided when the function
      is called. Wherever <tt>file</tt> appears in the function definition,
      the actual data provided will be used.
      <h4> Function call</h4>
      The last line is not part of the function definition. It is a function call:
      it runs the <tt>show</tt> function. The name <tt>&lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;</tt>
      is given as the argument to the <tt>show</tt> function. You could call
      the same function for a different file by providing a different file name.
      <h3> Conditions: the if-expression</h3>
      Suppose you want to print only certain lines of a file, not all of them.
      Suppose you want to print only those lines containing a text string you
      specify. Use the if-expression to run code only if a condition tests true.
      <p>Add lines before and after the print function call, change the name of
        the function to find, and add a second argument to it, so that the function
        definition looks like this:
      <pre>        ? def find(file, substring) :void {
        >     for line in file {
        >         if (line.includes(substring)) {
        >             print(line)
        >         }
        >     }
        > }
        # value: &lt;find></pre>
      Add a second argument value to the function call:
      <pre>        ? find(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;, &quot;and&quot;)</pre>
      Now only the lines in the file jabberwocky.txt that contain the string &quot;and&quot;
      are printed in the Program window.
      <blockquote>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
        The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;</blockquote>
      The line that contains &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; is included because of the
      &quot;and&quot; in &quot;Bandersnatch&quot;. The line that contains &quot;And&quot;
      is not included because the comparison is case-sensitive.
      <p>Try the function call again specifying a different text string.
      <h3> Function Calls and Message Calls</h3>
      You have been using the print function to display text. The <tt>print</tt>
      function is a function built into <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. The variable named &quot;<tt>print</tt>&quot;
      is simply a predefined variable initialized to hold this built-in function
      as its initial value. A function is simply an object that can be called
      with function-call notation. In other words, it can be called with a (possibly
      empty) list of arguments enclosed in parentheses. In the <tt>show</tt>
      and <tt>find</tt> examples above, you defined your own new functions.
      <p>What about the line containing <tt>includes</tt>?
      <pre>        line.includes(substring)</pre>
      Here, we are also calling an object, the value of the <tt>line</tt>
      variable, which will be a string. However, this is a <i>message call</i>,
      but not a <i>function call</i>. We are calling line with the message <tt>includes(substring)</tt>.
      Between the parentheses is an argument list, just as in a function call.
      To the left of argument list is a <i>message name</i>, &quot;<tt>includes</tt>&quot;.
      A message is used to ask the object to do something for us. Of the many
      things an object might do for us, the message name is used to distinguish
      which one we are asking it to do. Here, we are asking a string to tell us
      whether the substring can be found within itself, ie, whether it <i>includes</i>
      the substring. We expect an answer of <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.
      <p>A function call is actually just a message call in which no message name
        is provided. It requests the object to <i>do its thing</i> with the provided
        arguments. For the <tt>print</tt> function, <i>its thing</i> consists
        of printing these arguments to the display.
      <p>In the next chapter, we will see how to define new objects that respond
        to message calls, not just function calls.
      <h2> Mappings: the <tt>=></tt> operator</h2>
      E supports several features that facilitate working with files. You have
      already used one of these features in the function call:
      <pre>        find(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;, &quot;and&quot;)</pre>
      The prefix <tt>file:</tt> tells E to create an object that represents
      the designated file, and enables it to be opened. In E, collections are
      mappings from <i>keys</i> of some sort to <i>values</i> of some sort. A
      for-loop can be used on any collection. When used on a file, the file is
      assumed to be a text file, and considered a collection mapping from line
      numbers (starting at 1, since this is the text file convention) to corresponding
      lines of the file. Each time around the for-loop, the key is the next line
      number and the value is a string with the contents of that line (including
      a terminating newline). So for your example file, the mapping is:
      <blockquote>
        <table border cellspacing=4 cellpadding=4 >
          <tr>
            <th>Keys</th>
            <th>Values</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <div align=right>1 <br>
                2 <br>
                3 <br>
                4 <br>
                5 <br>
                6 <br>
                7 <br>
                8 <br>
                9</div>
            </td>
            <td>'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
              Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
              All mimsy were the borogoves, <br>
              And the mome raths outgrabe.
              <p>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
                The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
                Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
                The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      You can access the keys of a mapping using the <tt>=></tt> operator.
      This operator is read <i>maps to</i>, as in &quot;<tt>k => v</tt>&quot;
      reading &quot;<i>k maps to v</i>&quot;.
      <p>Add to the for-loop and the print function call so your program looks
        like this:
      <pre>        ? def find(file, substring) :void {
        >     for num => line in file {
        >         if (line.includes(substring)) {
        >             print(`$num:$line`)
        >         }
        >     }
        > }
        > find(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest/jabberwocky.txt&gt;, &quot;and&quot;)</pre>
      You get the same lines that printed before, and now the lines are numbered.
      <blockquote>1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
        9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;</blockquote>
      <h2> String concatenation</h2>
      The <tt>+</tt> operator asks its left operand (using a <i>message call</i>)
      to add the right operand to itself and answer with the result. If the left
      operand is a number, it will try to perform numeric addition to satisfy
      the request. If the left operand is a string, it performs concatenation;
      it appends the second argument -- converted to a string -- to the end of
      the first and returns the result. In the expression:
      <pre>        print(&quot;&quot; + num + &quot;:&quot; + line)</pre>
      the argument to the <tt>print</tt> function is a concatenation of four
      strings.
      <p>Why the empty string? The variable <tt>num</tt> actually contains
        a numeric value, not a string. The concatenation succeeds because the
        empty string automatically converts the numeric value in <tt>num</tt>
        to the equivalent string as a result of trying to concatenate <tt>num</tt>
        with itself. The result of this is a string, which is then asked to add
        the next argument, and so on. If the expression began with <tt>num</tt>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>print(num + &quot;:&quot; + line)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      The value of num, which is a number, would expect a numeric value to add
      to itself and would generate an exception when it encountered the string
      &quot;:&quot; instead.
      <h2> Calling Java methods</h2>
      The E interpreter not only runs on Java, it makes all Java objects available
      in E as if they had been written in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. For example, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s string objects are
      simply normal Java string objects -- instance of the Java class <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">java.lang.String</a>.
      As a result, (with some <a href="../kernel/e2j-binding.html">exceptions</a>
      resulting from the difference between <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s semantics and Java's semantics)
      all of String's public messages are also available from <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>.
      <p>Change the if-expression condition:
      <pre>        ? def find(file, substring) :void {
        >     for num => line in file {
        >         if (line.indexOf(substring) != -1) {
        >             print(`$num:$line`)
        >         }
        >     }
        > }
        # value: &lt;find&gt;</pre>
      You get the same result as before. Since line is a string, you can call
      the String method <tt><a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)">indexOf</a></tt>,
      which returns the index (or position) of a specified substring if the substring
      exists, or -1 if the substring is not found.
      <p>E runs on all platforms compatible with at least Javasoft's JDK-1.1.7.
        If you are running E on a Java-1.1.7 or later platform, the public messages
        documented <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/packages.html">here</a>
        are available to you. If you are running E on a Java-1.2.x (also known
        as Java-2.x) or later platform, the public messages documented <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/index.html">here</a>
        are available to you as well. However, if you use messages that are only
        available on a more recent platform, only those people running at least
        that more recent platform will be able to use your E program.
      <p>Of course, Java libraries written by yourself and others are available
        from E in the same way as libraries written by Javasoft.
      <h3> Calling a function from another function</h3>
      So far you have written a function that reads a specified file and prints
      out any lines containing a specified string. To make good use of the function
      you have written, you would call it more than once.
      <p>Let's write another function that calls your function for all .txt files
        in a directory.
      <pre>        ? def findall(dir, substring) :void {
        >     for file in dir {
        >         if (file.getName().endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {
        >             find(file, substring)
        >         }
        >     }
        > }
        # value: &lt;findall>

        ? findall(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest&gt;, &quot;and&quot;)</pre>
      You get at least the same result as before. If you have other .txt files
      in your jabbertest directory, and if they contain the string &quot;and&quot;,
      you will get additional lines.
      <h2> The File class</h2>
      The for-loop
      <pre>        for file in dir {</pre>
      runs once for each element of dir. The elements of dir are File objects,
      instances of the <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/api/java/io/File.html">java.io.File</a>
      class. On each iteration of the loop, the variable file contains a different
      File object.
      <p>The if-expression
      <pre>        if (file.getName().endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {</pre>
      contains two method calls:
      <pre>        file.getName()</pre>
      calls the <tt><a href="../../javadoc/java/io/File.html#getName()">getName</a></tt>
      method of the File class, which returns as a String the name of the file
      that the File object represents.
      <pre>        endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)</pre>
      calls the <tt><a
      href="../../javadoc/java/lang/String.html#endsWith(java.lang.String)">endsWith</a></tt>
      method of the String class, which returns true if the String object ends
      with the specified argument string.
      <h2> Recursion: calling a function from itself</h2>
      Now you have a function that checks all the files in a directory. However,
      it ignores subdirectories. It would be useful if it could check files in
      subdirectories as well.
      <p>Checking subdirectories is tricky, because a directory tree can have
        any number of branches of any length. You cannot know ahead of time how
        many levels of subdirectories to search. What you need is a way to say
        &quot;keep going until you get to the end.&quot; Recursion provides this
        functionality. Recursion happens when a function calls itself.
      <p>To create a simple directory tree to test, create a subdirectory in your
        jabbertest directory called <tt>test</tt>. Make a copy of jabberwocky.txt
        and put the copy in the <tt>test</tt> subdirectory.
      <p>Change the <tt>findall</tt> function by renaming the <tt>dir</tt>
        argument and replacing the for-loop with a compound if-expression:
      <pre>        ? def findall(dirfile, substring) :void {
        >    if (dirfile.isDirectory()) {
        >        for file in dirfile {
        >            findall(file, substring)
        >        }
        >    } else if (dirfile.getName().endsWith(&quot;.txt&quot;)) {
        >        find(dirfile, substring)
        >    }
        > }
        # value: &lt;findall>

        ? findall(&lt;file:c:/jabbertest&gt;, &quot;and&quot;)</pre>
      You get (at least):
      <blockquote>1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
        9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot; <br>
        1:'Twas brillig and the slithy toves <br>
        2:Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>
        8:Beware the Jubjub bird and shun <br>
        9:The frumious Bandersnatch.&quot;</blockquote>
      plus the lines containing &quot;and&quot; from any other .txt files you
      have anywhere in your file system. How would you modify this program to
      show the name of the file in which the match was found?
      <h3> Compound if-expression</h3>
      The above if-expression has a second clause that beigin with &quot;<tt>else
      if</tt>&quot;.
      <p>If the condition of the first clause is true, the first clause is run
        and the second clause is ignored.
      <p>If the condition of the first clause is false, and the condition of the
        second clause is true, the second clause is run.
      <p>If the condition of the first clause is false, and the condition of the
        second clause is false, none of the if-expression is run.
      <p>When <tt>findall</tt> is called, the variable <tt>dirfile</tt>
        will contain an instance of the File class that represents either a directory
        or a file. The first clause of the if-expression is run if the object
        in dirfile represents a directory. If it does not, you know that the object
        represents a file. In that case, the condition of the second clause test
        if it is a .txt file. If it is, the second clause performs the string
        search operation that you have been doing all along. If <tt>dirfile</tt>
        is neither a directory nor a .txt file, then <tt>findall</tt> does
        nothing.
      <p>A danger in recursion is that with each function call, the function calls
        itself again, creating a never-ending loop. In this example, the <tt>findall</tt>
        function will stop calling itself when it can find no more directories,
        which has to happen eventually.
      <p><i>Note: Under Windows, a directory tree must be finite, and therefore
        the above routine is safe. Under Unix, on the other hand, symbolic links
        can be used to create cycles -- effectively infinite directory trees.
        In a later chapter <font color="#FF0000">(*** link needed)</font>, we
        will see how to finitely walk such &quot;infinite&quot; cyclic structures.</i>
