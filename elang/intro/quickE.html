      <hr> <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" --> This document is intended as a 15-minute
      introduction to <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. Many--even
      most--of the constructs of the language are not even mentioned. But the
      constructs left out are ones that should be straightforward to learn for
      anyone who has programmed in Java. We leap almost directly to a discussion
      of the features that make <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> unique,
      starting with the <i>eventually</i> operator and its attendant features.
      For a succinct view of the syntax of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
      and its traditional programming constructs, refer to the <a href="../quick-ref.html"><i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
      Quick Reference Card</a>.
      <p>Most of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> looks and acts like
        a conventional object-oriented programming language. A few quick examples
        are:</p>
      <p>The declaration of a variable and the assignment statement look a bit
        like Pascal: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">a</span> := 1 + 2
<span class="comment"># Comments can start with a #</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The if-statement looks quite familiar to anyone who has done C:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">if</span> (a == b) { a := 3 * a }</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The print-statement looks much like Java:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>println(&quot;<span class="litchars">Here's the answer</span>&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The creation of an object looks a little different, but is easily understood
        by anyone who has written Java; in this example, we use the carMaker object
        (which behaves like a class) to create a car: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">car</span> := carMaker(&quot;<span class="keyword">Mercedes</span>&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Calling a method on an object looks somewhat like C++, Python, or Java,
        with a period separating the object from the method name:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>car.moveTo(2,3)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For the purposes of this introduction, this ends our coverage of the
        ordinary object-oriented E features. Let us now launch into the features
        that make E unique. We start with the <i>eventually</i> operator, &quot;<tt>&lt;-</tt>&quot;:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>car &lt;- moveTo(2,3)
println(&quot;<span class="litchars">car will eventually move to 2,3. But not yet.</span>&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The first statement can be read as, &quot;car, eventually moveTo(2,3)&quot;.
        As soon as this <i>eventual send</i> has been made to the car, the program
        immediately moves on to the next sequential statement--the program does
        not wait for the car to move. Since the program does not wait around for
        the eventual send, an eventual send is very different from a traditional
        object-oriented method call (referred to here as an <i>immediate call</i>
        to distinguish it from an eventual send; the statement &quot;car.moveTo(2,3)&quot;,
        shown earlier, is an immediate call). In general, you do not know, and
        cannot know, exactly when the car will move; indeed, if the car is on
        a remote computer, and the communication link is lost, the car may never
        move at all (which throws an exception,discussed later). </p>
      <p>This brings us to the most interesting feature of an eventual send: just
        as you do not know when the operation will complete, you also do not know,
        and <i>do not need to know</i>, where the car is. The car could be a local
        object running on the same machine with the program... or it could be
        on a computer a thousand miles away across the Internet. Regardless, E
        keeps track of the car's location and delivers the message for you. Moreover,
        if the car is indeed remote, E sets up a secure communication link between
        the program and the car; and since the Universal Resource Identifier for
        the car includes an ungueassable random string of characters, no one can
        send a message to the car or extract information from the car except someone
        who has explicitly and intentionally received a reference to it from someone
        with authority. Thus a computation running on five computers scattered
        across five continents, all publicly accessible by the whole world of
        the Web,can be as secure as a computation running on a box locked in your
        basement.</p>
      <p>Another very interesting feature of the eventual send: because the program
        continues on to the next statement immediately, without waiting for the
        eventual send to finish, <i>deadlock can never occur</i>.</p>
      <p>Finally, note that the eventual send invoked an ordinary object method
        (&quot;moveTo(x,y)&quot;)in the car. The programmer who created the carMaker
        defines the cars to have ordinary methods, with ordinary returns of values
        (or null if no value need be returned). He does not know and does not
        need to know whether objects that invoke those methods use calls or sends,
        and does not know or need to know whether those invoking objects are local
        or remote. </p>
      <p>When you make an eventual send to an object (referred to hereafter simply
        as a <i>send</i>, which contrasts with a <i>call</i> to a local object
        that waits for the action to complete), even though the action may not
        occur for a long time, you immediately get back a promise for the result
        of the action:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">carPromise</span> := carMaker &lt;- new(&quot;<span class="litchars">Mercedes</span>&quot;)
carPromise &lt;- moveTo(2,3)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In this example, we have sent the carMaker object the &quot;new(name)&quot;
        message. Eventually the carMaker will create the new car on the same computer
        where the carMaker resides; in the meantime, we get back a promise for
        the car. We can make eventual sends to the promise just as if it were
        indeed the car, but we cannot make immediate calls to the promise even
        if the carMaker (and therefore the car it creates) actually live on the
        same computer with the program. To make immediate calls on the promised
        object, you must set up an action to occur when the promise <i>resolves</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">temperaturePromise</span> := carPromise &lt;- getEngineTemperature()
<span class="keyword">when</span> (temperaturePromise) -&gt; <span class="defobj">done</span>(<span class="defvar">temperature</span>) {
    println(`<span class="litchars">The temperature of the car engine is: </span>$temperature`)
} <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">e</span> {
    println(`<span class="litchars">Could not get engine temperature, error: </span>$e`)
}
println(&quot;<span class="litchars">execution of the when-catch waits for resolution of the </span>" +
        &quot;<span class="litchars">promise, but the program moves on immediately to this println</span>&quot;)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We can read the when-catch statement as, &quot;when the promise for a
        temperature becomes done, and therefore the temperature is locally available,
        perform the main action block... but if something goes wrong, catch the
        error in variable e and perform the error block&quot;. Inside the when-catch
        statement, we say that the promise has been <i>resolved</i>. In this example,
        we have requested the engine temperature from the carPromise. Eventually
        the carPromise resolves to a car and receives the request for engine temperature;
        then eventually the temperaturePromise resolves into an actual temperature.
        The when-catch construct waits for the temperature to resolve into an
        actual (integer) temperature, but <i>only</i> the when-catch construct
        waits. The program itself does not wait: rather, it proceeds on, with
        methodical determination, to the next statement following the when-catch.</p>
      <p>The temperature is an integer and is guaranteed to resolve to a local
        integer object upon which you can make immediate calls, even if the car
        is remote. Immutable objects, such as integers, floating point numbers,
        booleans, arrays, and the E data structures ConstLists and ConstMaps,
        are always <i>passed by copy</i>, so you always get a local copy of the
        object if one of these is returned by a method call or send. This local
        copy can of course accept immediate calls. Mutable objects like cars reside
        on the machine upon which they were constructed. So in general, if you
        created the car using an eventual send, you will probably have to interact
        with the car using eventual sends forever, since only such sends are guaranteed
        to work with remote objects.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">farCar</span> := carMaker &lt;- new(&quot;<span class="litchars">Mercedes</span>&quot;)
farCar &lt;- moveTo(2,3)
farCar &lt;- moveTo(5,6)
farCar &lt;- moveTo(7,3)
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">fuelPromise</span> := farCar &lt;- fuelRemaining()</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here we have created a farCar using an eventual send to the carMaker.
        Earlier, we declared a variable temperaturePromise, wherein the suffix
        of &quot;Promise&quot; was a notational reminder that indeed this was
        only a promise, and it could not receive immediate calls except inside
        a when-catch construct where the promise would have resolved into an actual
        local copy of the temperature. </p>
      <p>In this example, we use the prefix &quot;far&quot; as a notational reminder
        that this car may be (indeed, probably is) executing on a remote machine,
        and that consequently we can never make immediate calls to it. It is a
        reminder that we will always have to make eventual sends to it for any
        interactions we desire. Technically, what we get back immediately from
        the carMaker is still only a promise, but since the promise and the farCar
        both respond identically to sends, and both respond identically to calls
        (by throwing an error), we treat it the same as if the promise had already
        been resolved to a remote reference, and name the variable using the remote
        reference convention. In a real program, the carMaker object would probably
        be a remote reference as well, and would actually have the variable name
        farCarMaker to follow the convention.</p>
      <p>The example moves the farCar around repeatedly and then asks for the
        amount of fuel remaining. This displays another important property of
        eventual sends: if object A sends several messages to object B, it is
        guaranteed that those messages will arrive and be processed in the order
        of sending. This is only a partial ordering, however. From B's point of
        view, there are no guarantees that the messages from A will not be interspersed
        with messages from C, D, etc. Also, from A's point of view, there are
        no guarantees that, if A sends messages to both B and C, the message to
        B will resolve before (or after) the message from C, regardless of the
        order in which A initiates the messages. Despite those uncertainties,
        however, in the example the partial ordering is sufficient to guarantee
        that fuelPromise will resolve to the quantity of fuel remaining after
        all three of the moveTo() operations have occurred, and that those moveTos
        will have been performed in the specified sequence.</p>
      <p>There is one reason to use a when-catch construct to resolve the promise
        for a far object. This reason is to do a test for equality, i.e., to see
        whether the promised object is the same object you received from another
        activity:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">when</span> (raceTrack &lt;- getPolePositionCar()) -&gt; <span class="defobj">done</span>(<span class="defvar">farPolePositionCar</span>)          {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (farPolePositionCar == myCar) {
        println(&quot;<span class="litchars">My car is in pole position</span>&quot;)
    }
} <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">e</span> {}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Note that the catch clause is empty. Because remote references across
        a network are much less reliable than immediate calls to objects collocated
        with the program, you will usually want to handle the error case. However,
        if you have many pending actions with a single remote object, all the
        catch clauses for all those actions will start up if the connection fails,
        so you may want to disregard most of the catch clauses and focus on handling
        the larger problem (loss of connection) in one place. In this example,
        there is no compelling special action to take if you can't find out whether
        your car is in pole position, so no action is taken.</p>
      <p>If you write a function or method that must get values from a far object
        before returning an answer, your function should return promise for the
        answer, and fulfill that answer later. You can create your own promises
        using the Ref.promise() primitive in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">promiseMilesBeforeEmpty</span>(<span class="defvar">farCar</span>) :any{
    <span class="keyword">def</span> [<span class="defvar">milesBeforeEmptyPromise</span>, <span class="defvar">milesBeforeEmptyResolver</span>] := Ref.promise()

    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">e</span> {
        milesBeforeEmptyResolver.smash(`<span class="litchars">Car Lost: </span>$e`)
    }
    <span class="keyword">return</span> milesBeforeEmptyPromise
}

<span class="comment"># Somewhere else in the program</span>

} <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">e</span> {
    println(`<span class="litchars">Error: </span>$e`)
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Once again our example highlights several different features of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>.
        The basic idea of the example is that the function promiseMilesBeforeEmpty(farCar)
        will eventually compute the number of miles the car can still travel before
        it is out of fuel; later in the program, when this computation is resolved,
        the program will print the value. However, before we can do the computation,
        we must first get both the fuelRemaining and the milesPerGallon values
        from the far car.</p>
      <p>The promise and the resolver for that promise are created as a pair using
        the Ref.promise() built-in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
        primitive. They are &quot;normal&quot; variables in the sense that they
        can be passed as arguments, returned from methods as answers, and sent
        messages: the resolver can even accept immediate calls, though the promise
        of course cannot. In this example, the function returns the milesBeforeEmptyPromise
        to the caller just as it would return any other kind of value.</p>
      <p>To cause the promise to resolve, call the resolver (or send to the resolver
        if the resolve may be remote to your program) with the &quot;resolve(value)&quot;
        method. To <i>break</i> the promise (which produces an exception that
        will cause the catch clause of a when-catch to execute), call the resolver
        with the &quot;smash(value)&quot; method.</p>
      <p>The naming conventions used here are worth noticing. The function has
        the suffix &quot;promise&quot;, informing the user of the function that
        the function will return a promise rather than an actual value, and the
        user will therefore have to resolve the promise before using the answer.
        Also, the parameter for the function has the prefix &quot;far&quot;. We
        have seen the &quot;far&quot; prefix before, as a reminder to the author
        not to make immediate calls. Here, as a convention in a parameter list,
        the &quot;far&quot; prefix has the following deeper implication: by calling
        the parameter &quot;farCar&quot;, the author of the function is making
        a commitment to users that nowhere in the function will the author use
        immediate calls: the author will only interact with the farCar using eventual
        sends. So the &quot;far&quot; convention in this case is not only a reminder,
        it can actually act as an important part of the function's contract.</p>
      <p>Another interesting naming issue arises here: You may have noticed that
        the variable fuelRemaining is created using an eventual send. In fact,
        at the moment of creation, this variable contains only a promise, not
        a value. Our normal convention would be to give this variable a name such
        as fuelRemainingPromise. However, in this case, the fuelRemaining variable
        is never used except in the when-catch construct defined shortly after
        the creation of the variable. Inside this when-catch construct, the fuelRemaining
        promise is guaranteed to have been resolved. How do we know the promise
        is resolved, even though the when-catch does not explicitly resolve the
        value? Because, as noted earlier, a series of messages sent to a single
        remote object by a single program are guaranteed to be processed (and
        resolved) in the sequence in which they are sent. Therefore, the milesBeforeEmptyPromise
        cannot resolve until after the fuelRemaining promise has been fulfilled,
        and since the milesBeforeEmptyPromise is guaranteed to have been fulfilled
        inside the when-catch, fuelRemaining is also guaranteed to have been fulfilled.
        Upon fulfillment of the promise, the variable containing the promise is
        itself filled with the actual value. Therefore, fuelRemaining does indeed
        contain a value (not a promise) by the time it is actually used. And as
        a minor observation, note that inside the when-catch construct both milesBeforeEmptyPromise
        and milesBeforeEmpty contain the same resolved value.</p>
      <p>As discussed earlier, though we can guarantee the ordering of messages
        sent and answers received coming back to a single program from a single
        object, when a program sends messages to several objects, the order in
        which answers will be received cannot be predicted. You can nest when-catch
        clauses to ensure several the resolutions have taken place before doing
        a computation:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">mercedesDistancePromise</span> := mercedes &lt;- distanceToFinishLine()
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">chevyDistancePromise</span> := chevy &lt;- distanceToFinishLine()
<span class="keyword">when</span> (mercedesDistancePromise) -&gt; <span class="defobj">done</span>(<span class="defvar">mercedesDistance</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">when</span> (chevyDistancePromise) -&gt; <span class="defobj">done2</span>(<span class="defvar">chevyDistance</span>) {
        <span class="keyword">if</span> (chevyDistance &lt; mercedesDistance) {
            println(&quot;<span class="litchars">Chevy is in the lead</span>&quot;)
        } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
            println(&quot;<span class="litchars">Mercedes is in the lead</span>&quot;)
        }
    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">chevyE</span> {
        println(&quot;<span class="litchars">Chevy lost</span>&quot;)
    }
} <span class="keyword">catch</span> <span class="defvar">mercedesE</span> {
    println(&quot;<span class="litchars">Mercedes lost</span>&quot;)
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Here, to determine which car was leading the race, we had to get the
        distance f rom the finish line for each of the cars. We compute the leader
        inside nested when-catch constructs to ensure we have all the distances
        before trying to compare them. One very important syntactic note: we see
        in this example that the &quot;done(variable)&quot; clause of the when-catch
        construct is actually <i>the declaration of a function and a parameter</i>.
        The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this introduction, but the
        operational consequence is that you can use different names for the &quot;done&quot;
        function, and indeed you <i>must</i> use different names if you have multiple
        when-catch clauses in the same scope. Nested when-catch clauses put the
        &quot;done&quot; functions into the same scope. In the actual example
        here, we gave the inner when-catch &quot;done&quot; function the name
        &quot;done2&quot; to prevent the name collision. We also gave the error-containing
        variables in the catch clauses different names, chevyE and mercedesE.</p>
      <p>We end this introduction by answering a last, critical question: How
        does a program acquire its very first reference to an object on a different
        computer? In all our examples up to this point, we have always started
        out with a reference to at least one remote object, and we retrieved other
        remote objects by asking that object for other objects: for example, we
        asked a remote carMaker for a new (remote) car, and were able to immediately
        work with the car just like any other remote object. How did we get the
        reference to the carMaker in the first place?</p>
      <p>In E, the reference to an object can be encoded as a Universal Resource
        Identifier string, known as a <i>uri</i> (the familiar <i>url</i> of the
        Web is a type of uri). This uri string can be passed around in many fashions;
        one good secure way of passing a uri is to save it as a text file, encrypt
        and sign it with PGP, and send it in email. If you wish to run a seriously
        secure distributed E system, encrypting the uris is crucial: indeed, the
        passing of the uris from machine to machine is the main security issue
        that E cannot address for you. Other ways uris have been passed in operational
        E systems have been to send the uri over an ssh connection, and (less
        securely) by reading the uri off over a telephone! If you are using E
        on a local area network and have no security concerns, but are using E
        simply because it is simpler, safer, and more maintainable for distributed
        computing, the uris can be stored in files on a shared file system and
        read directly by the programs on different computers as they start up.</p>
      <p>The functions makeURIFromObject(object) and getObjectFromURI(uri) detailed
        in the E Quick Reference Card perform the basic transformations you need
        to hook up objects on multiple computers. Each program that expects to
        work with remote objects needs to invoke the primitive &quot;introducer
        onTheAir&quot; before starting any remote connections, including the making
        or using of uris. An example of these functions working together can be
        found in the Securit-Echat system.</p>
      <p>The promise architecture described here is the heart of what makes E
        different. There are no multiple threads, no synchronize statements, no
        critical objects, no deadlocks. Yet the promise architecture allows the
        construction of all the different distributed programming behaviors that
        more conventional architectures allow. The consequence is that distributed
        systems written in E are more robust and easier to work with-- once you
        have grasped the implications of promises. However, though this introduction
        may have taken only 15 minutes, most people will find it takes more time
        and more thought to fully appreciate the ramifications. As noted at the
        beginning, the E Quick Reference Card is a compact introduction to all
        the features of E, and may be the next useful place to go. Beyond that,
        the Securit-Echat system is a very small but full featured example of
        E at work, documented in detail for the explicit purpose of being a learning
        tool.</p>
      <p>When first using a promise architecture, people often have a sense of
        breathlessness, a feeling that once they have started a series of remote
        computations, they have lost control of the action. This sense can actually
        become a sense of panic if the sense of lost controlled is accompanied
        by a sense of lost understanding. There are multiple techniques and patterns
        for &quot;reining in&quot; the remote computations. Several of these can
        be found in the Securit-Edesk program, including the promiseAllDone function,
        the vowsMonitorMaker, the Sequencer, and the summoning pattern. Feel free
        to join the E Language Discussion group if these matters become of serious
        interest to you.</p>
