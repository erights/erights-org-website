      <p>The reference to the recipient is the value of the expression on the 
        left and the arguments are the values of the expressions between the parens. 
        As is typical in E, expressions are evaluated left to right, and variables 
        defined on the left are visible on the right. The reference to the recipient 
        attempts to convey the message to the recipient. If it succeeds, the message 
        is delivered to the recipient in its own turn. The send expression itself 
        always immediately evaluates to a value -- it never performs a non-local 
        exit. The value of the send expression is a reference to the result of 
        the eventual delivery. 
      <h2>Partially Ordered Fail-Stop Delivery</h2>
      <p>Successive messages sent on the same reference must be delivered in the 
        order sent. Since distributed systems do not allow for reliable message 
        delivery channels, an EVENTUAL reference instead must be fail-stop: reliable 
        up to the first failure to deliver, and it must never deliver any more 
        messages. Therefore, a successful delivery demonstrates that earlier messages 
        sent on the same reference must have been delivered. A failed reference 
        must eventually become BROKEN. <br>
        <i> See also <a href="../../elib/concurrency/partial-order.html#full-order">Two 
        Party Full Order</a>.</i>
      <p>When a reference is included within an argument of a send, we say the 
        reference has been <i>forked</i>, and that what is received is not the 
        sent reference but a <i>fork</i> of the sent reference. Messages sent 
        on a reference before it is forked must be delivered to the recipient 
        prior to message sent of the reference after the fork of course, but also 
        prior to messages sent on that fork of the reference. Messages sent on 
        the original reference after the fork, and messages sent of the fork, 
        represent two separate full orders. These messages may be delivered in 
        any interleaving of these orders. <br>
        <i>See also <a href="../../elib/concurrency/partial-order.html#tree-order">Three 
        Party Tree Order</a>.</i>
      <p>Given two references, x and y, that designate the same recipient, &quot;<tt>E 
        join(x, y)</tt>&quot; returns a new reference that also designates that 
        recipient. Messages sent on either x or y prior to the join must be delivered 
        prior to messages sent on the joined reference. The joined reference itself 
        is simultaneously a fork of x and y -- if messages are sent on all following 
        the join, these messages may be delivered in any interleaving of their 
        respective orders. <br>
        <i>See also <a href="../../elib/equality/after-both.html">Four Party Partial 
        Order</a>.</i>
      <p>Of course, if a reference should fail prior to a fork or join, the fork 
        or join of the reference is born failed, it may not deliver any messages, 
        and it must eventually become BROKEN. 
      <h2>Delivery by Reference Type</h2>
      <p>To understand the behavior of send in detail, it's useful to break it 
        down according to the type of reference to the recipient.</p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>NEAR. If the reference is NEAR, then the recipient is in the same 
            vat as the sender, and the reference is reliable up to crash/revival. 
            A send queues the pending delivery in this vat's pending delivery 
            queue, which won't get serviced until the current turn is done. The 
            send evaluates to a promise for the outcome of the delivery. The delivery 
            can only exit by evaluating to a result, in which case this becomes 
            the resolution of the promise, or by throwing a problem, in which 
            case the promise becomes BROKEN with this problem. 
          <p> The holder of the promise, if he sees it become BROKEN, cannot assume 
            the recipient threw, as the recipient may instead have returned a 
            BROKEN reference as its normal result. Similarly, if the promise remains 
            EVENTUAL, the holder of the promise cannot assume that delivery hasn't 
            happened yet, as the recipient may have returned an EVENTUAL reference 
            as its normal result. This ambiguity is intentional -- it allows better 
            abstraction of the recipient's duties. </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>BROKEN. If the reference is BROKEN, it will not deliver any messages, 
            and the problem associated with the reference attempts to explain 
            why not. A send to a broken reference evaluates to a reference broken 
            with the same problem -- which can often be the same reference.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Far reference (EVENTUAL, Resolved). A Far reference is a reference 
            to a specific recipient in a foreign vat. If a far reference succeeds 
            at delivering the message, the message is queued in the foreign vat 
            for eventual delivery to the recipient. Although this delivery may 
            happen while the sending turn is still in progress, because the two 
            vats have no synchronous access to each other, these are still isolated 
            transactions. Side effects in the receiving turn can have no effect 
            on the sending turn.</p>
          <p>A send on a Far reference immediately evaluates to a promise for 
            the outcome of the delivery. All the outcomes explained for NEAR reference 
            are possible. In addition, if the promise becomes BROKEN with a PartitionException, 
            then either </p>
          <p> 
          <ol>
            <li> 
              <p>The inter-vat connection failed, preventing the delivery of the 
                message.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
              <p>The inter-vat connection failed, preventing the promise from 
                resolving to the actual outcome.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
              <p>The outcome of the delivery was indeed either a reference broken 
                by a PartitionException or a throw of a PartitionException.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>This ambiguity is intentional. It is a fundamental constraint of 
            distributed systems that cases #1 and #2 cannot be distinguished. 
            Case #3 may result from the recipient in turn experiencing a communications 
            problem in its own subcontracting of parts of the job. This protocol 
            allows such problem reports to propogate to interested parties.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Promise (EVENTUAL, Unresolved). A promise doesn't yet know who the 
            recipient is, but is nevertheless a conveyance for sending messages 
            to whoever it turns out to be. Messages sent on a promise queue up 
            in the promise itself until the promise is resolved -- until a reference 
            to the recipient is determined. At this point, the messages are resent 
            on this reference, which may recursively be any of these cases. It 
            is equivalent for a promise to become broken and for it to resolve 
            to a broken reference. Promises come in two flavors: </p>
          <p> 
          <ol>
            <li> 
              <p>A LocalPromise has both the Ref end (the tail of the arrow) and 
                the Resolver end (the head of the arror) in the same vat, so it 
                is reliable up to crash/revive.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
              <p>A FarPromise spans vats, and so is reliable only up to partition.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
