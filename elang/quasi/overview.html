        <pre>printf("hello %s world\n", worldState);</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">as contrasted with the modern</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>out.print("hello " + worldState + " world\n");</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">They both say approximately the same thing, but the notation 
        of the first is optimized to make visible the nature of the resulting 
        value: It'll be like the format string but with the %-holes filled in. 
        The second form is instead optimized to make visible the nature of the 
        computation that will produce this value. Unfortunately for my explanation, 
        the difference doesn't seem to make much difference on this case. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Though less familiar, the point is clearer with Lisp's quasi-quote, 
        since it expands to a normal expression: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>`(hello ,worldState world)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">which means "A list whose first element is the literal symbol 
        <tt>'hello</tt>, whose second element is the value of the variable 
        <tt>worldState</tt>, and whose third element is the literal symbol 
        <tt>'world</tt>." Like "%", "," marks a hole to be filled in at runtime. 
        This expression macro-expands to</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>(cons 'hello (cons worldState '(world)))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">which describes the process for making such a list. In the 
        first form, the nature of the list being produced is clear but the means 
        of its production -- two cons operations -- is obscure. In the second 
        form the reverse is true. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">I believe this observation about the respective strengths 
        and weaknesses of the two kinds of notations goes back to Alonzo Church, 
        the inventor of Lambda. For most purposes, more literal forms of expression 
        should be preferred when possible, for the same reasons that user interfaces 
        should work by "direct manipulation" where possible. Much of the popularity 
        of modern "scripting" languages -- Perl, Python, Tcl, etc -- is due to 
        their support for quasi-literal expression of text by "interpolation" 
        ($-substitution) and for quasi-literal text pattern matching by regular 
        expressions. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">As the Lisp language shows, there's no reason a language 
        can't enable literals (or quasi-literals) to express data types other 
        than scalars and strings, but few languages do. Lisp provides for the 
        [quasi-]literal expression of lists. But what about arbitrary user-defined 
        objects? By providing a pluggable quasi-parser framework, each quasi-parser 
        designer can define their own syntax for [quasi-]literally expressing 
        whatever data types they choose. In closing below, we propose a radical 
        future/past extension of this direction. </p>
      <hr>
      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="quasi-expr"></a>Quasi-Literal Expressions</h1>
      <p ALIGN="left">A quasi-literal expression consists of an optional quasi-parser 
        name (defaulting to "<tt>simple</tt>" if left out), a quasi-quote 
        (also known as backquote, "<tt>`</tt>"), a string in the grammar accepted 
        by that quasi-parser, and a closing quasi-quote. This string may also 
        have several embedded "$" &lt;identifier&gt; or "$" "{" &lt;E expression&gt; 
        "}" indicating values to be substituted in. The quasi-parser sees the 
        string without the embedded expression source. For example: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>foo`some text${bar() + 3}more text$baz`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">expands to</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>foo__quasiParser \
      valueMaker("some text${0}more text${1}") \
      substitute([bar() + 3, baz])
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The quasi-parser named "<tt>foo__quasiParser</tt>" is 
        looked up, and is asked to created a ValueMaker from the transformed string. 
        The transformation extracts each expression and leaves behind a "<tt>$</tt>" 
        "<tt>{</tt>" &lt;digit&gt;+ "<tt>}</tt>", ie, a "substitution 
        hole". Since this applies to all quasi-expressions, all quasi-grammars 
        must recognize these substitution holes. The resulting ValueMaker is then 
        invoked with a list of the values of the extracted expressions, which 
        the ValueMaker should "plug into" the corresponding substitution holes, 
        in order to make whatever kind of value the quasi-parser took to be described 
        by the quasi-string. We currently have two quasi-parsers that support 
        quasi-expressions: "<tt>simple__quasiParser</tt>" and "<tt>e__quasiParser</tt>". 
      </p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">&quot;simple&quot; Quasi-Expressions for Text</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">The "<tt>simple</tt>" quasi-parser is indeed the simplest 
        useful example consistent with these rules. Except for the embedded holes, 
        it takes the input text to just describe itself. Substitution consists 
        of stringification of the value, and string substitution. It corresponds 
        to the "interpolation" familiar from at least Perl, Tcl, and various shells: 
      </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="keyword">pragma</span>.syntax(&quot;<span class="litchars">0.8</span>&quot;)

? `abc${2+3}def`
# value: &quot;abc5def&quot;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The expression expands to</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>simple__quasiParser \
      valueMaker("abc${0}def") \
      substitute([2 + 3])</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">&quot;e&quot; Quasi-Expressions for Parse Trees</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">The "e" quasi-parser is simply E's own parser used as a 
        quasi-parser. It accepts E source-code as its quasi-grammar, and takes 
        it to describe ASTs (which we call parse trees) of the post-expansion 
        Kernel E language: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>? def sum := e`x + y`
# value: e`x.add(y)`

? def prod := e`a * $sum * b`
# value: e`a.multiply(x.add(y)).multiply(b)`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">In E, "<tt>+</tt>" and "<tt>*</tt>" are just syntactic 
        sugar for the "<tt>add</tt>" and "<tt>multiply</tt>" messages. 
        (Kernel E parse trees print as e`...` quasi-expressions as well.) Since 
        the substitution is structural, not textual, the fact that "<tt>*</tt>" 
        binds tighter in E than "<tt>+</tt>" does not cause confusion. "<tt><i>deriv.e</i></tt>" 
        in the distribution is a symbolic differentiation package written in E 
        using the <tt>e</tt> quasi-parser so that algebraic expressions can 
        be represented as trees, but expressed in familiar infix-operator notation. 
      </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Notice that each time the same quasi-expression is evaluated, 
        the <tt>valueMaker()</tt> argument is the same, though the <tt>substitute()</tt> 
        argument is usually different. Modulo some security issues beyond the 
        scope of this overview, quasi-parsers should therefore cache ValueMakers 
        by transformed string. It can then spend a lot of work "compiling" a ValueMaker 
        so that <tt>substitute()</tt> can go faster. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><i>See also <a href="../grammar/quasi-xml.html">Quasi-Literals and 
        XML</a>, which proposes to use XML DOM trees as the universal parse-tree 
        data structure.</i></p>
      <hr>
      <h1><a name="quasi-pattern"></a>Quasi-Literal Patterns</h1>
      <p>A quasi-literal pattern (a quasi-pattern) is also written as an optional 
        quasi-parser name, a quasi-quote, a quasi-string with embedded stuff, 
        and a closing quasi quote. This time the embedded stuff can consist of 
        several </p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>	"$"&lt;identifier&gt;
|	"$" "{" &lt;E expression&gt; "}"
|	"@"&lt;identifier&gt;
|	"@" "{" &lt;E pattern&gt; "}"</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">You can think of E's grammar as having two parsing contexts: 
        expression and pattern. A quasi-literal is parsed and transformed as a 
        quasi-expression or a quasi-pattern based on its parsing context. The 
        quasi-pattern transformation is more complex: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>? "abcde" =~ `a@{x}d@y`
# value: true

? x
# value: &quot;bc&quot;

? y
# value: &quot;e&quot;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">As in Perl, "=~" is the pattern match operator. It takes 
        an expression on the left and a pattern on the right. That first line 
        expands to: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>("abcde" =~ _4q ? (simple__quasiParser \
                       matchMaker("a@{0}d@{1}") \
                       matchBind([], _4q) =~ [x, y]))</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">"_4q" is an E-expansion-generated temporary variable name. 
        (By introducing a temporary variable, we can expand the pattern by itself 
        into a Kernel-E pattern, and we preserve the source's original left-to-right 
        order, necessary for both scoping and execution order.) The pattern constructs 
        needed to understand the above pattern are: </p>
      <table width="0%" cellpadding="4">
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <pre>&lt;identifier&gt;</pre>
          </td>
          <td>Always matches, and binds identifier to the specimen. This is the 
            only form of variable definition in E.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <pre>&lt;pattern&gt; "?" &lt;expression&gt;</pre>
          </td>
          <td>"<tt>?</tt>" is pronounced "such that". First matches &lt;pattern&gt; 
            to the specimen; if it succeeds, evaluates &lt;expression&gt; in the 
            resulting scope. If its value is true, then the such-that pattern 
            as a whole succeeds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td> 
            <pre>[&lt;pattern&gt;, ...]</pre>
          </td>
          <td>Matches a list of the same length by matching each element against 
            the corresponding pattern.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p ALIGN="left">So, reading from the inside out, the quasi-parser named 
        "<tt>simple</tt>" is asked to produce a MatchMaker from the string 
        "<tt>a@{0}d@{1}</tt>", which is presumed to be in the quasi-grammar 
        understood by this quasi-parser. (Once again, it pays for the quasi-parser 
        to cache a compiled MatchMaker indexed by this string.) The MatchMaker 
        is then asked to "<tt>matchBind(args, specimen)</tt>" where the args 
        are extracted from embedded <tt>$</tt>-expressions, as with the earlier 
        <tt>substitute(args)</tt>. '<tt>args</tt>' is here an empty list 
        since there were no embedded <tt>$</tt>-expressions, and the specimen 
        is here "<tt>abcde</tt>" by the logic of "<tt>?</tt>". </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">(Detail: If the argument to matchMaker contains more than 
        one @-hole with the same index number, then the quasiParser may reject 
        this string by throwing an exception. If the quasiParser accepts this 
        string, then it must treat the first occurrence of an @-hole of a given 
        index as a normal binding @-hole. All successive occurrences match only 
        if the value they would have bound is the same (E's "==") to the value 
        bound by the first occurrence. Note that this case will never be generated 
        by expanding a quasi-literal pattern.)</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">&quot;simple&quot; Quasi-Patterns for Matching Text</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">If the <tt>matchBind()</tt> fails, it returns null, 
        which will not match any list pattern, even the empty list pattern, resulting 
        in the overall match failing. If the <tt>matchBind()</tt> succeeds, 
        it returns a list with elements extracted from the specimen by <tt>@</tt>-holes, 
        and put into the list at positions corresponding to the <tt>@</tt>-numbers. 
        The MatchMaker resulting from the "<tt>simple</tt>" quasi-parser just 
        does the simplest useful anti-greedy (ascetic?) string match and extract 
        without backtrack consistent with this framework. Except for holes, all 
        characters just represent themselves and must match exactly.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">&quot;e&quot; Quasi-Patterns for Matching Trees</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">As with quasi-expressions, none of this is specific to text. 
        A MatchMaker can accept whatever kind of object it wishes as specimen 
        and extract whatever it wishes as the bindings. As you might guess, the 
        <tt>e</tt> quasi-parser can also be used to match parse trees and 
        extract subtrees. A portion of <i><tt>deriv.e</tt></i>:</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre><font class="comment">#
# What's the derivative of expr wrt var?  Ie, what's "d(expr)/d(var)"?
#
</font>def deriv(expr, var) :any {

    switch (expr) {

        match e`$var ** @exp` ? (isConst(exp))  {
            e`$exp * $var ** ($exp -1)`
        }
        match e`@a + @b` {
            def da := deriv(a, var)
            def db := deriv(b, var)
            e`$da + $db`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The last 3 lines could also have been written</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>e`${deriv(a, var)} + $(deriv(b, var)}`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">depending on your taste. These two examples show the similarity 
        between the match-bind-substitute styles of programming as practiced by 
        "scripting" languages on text, and that practiced by Prolog on trees of 
        symbols.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">&quot;rx&quot; Quasi-Patterns for Perl-5 Regular Expressions</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">The third quasi-parser currently available in E is named 
        "<tt>rx</tt>", standing for "Regular eXression". "<tt>rx</tt>" 
        takes a full Perl-5 regular expression engine obtained from <a href="http://www.oroinc.com">Original 
        Reusable Objects</a> (now <a href="http://www.savarese.org">Savarese.Org</a>) 
        and wraps it to turn it into a quasi-parser. (This quasi-parser is written 
        in E and is found in the E distribution as "<tt><i>PerlMatchMakerMaker.emaker</i></tt>".) 
        As expected, most of the work is in the treatment of holes. The equivalent 
        of the above string match written using "<tt>rx</tt>" rather than 
        "<tt>simple</tt>" would be: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>? "abcde" =~ rx`a(@{x}.*?)d(@y.*)`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The expansion is the same of course, except that the "<tt>rx</tt>" 
        quasi parser is looked up instead of "simple", and the transformed string 
        fed to matchMaker() is </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>"a(@{0}.*?)d(@{1}.*)"</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Parentheses play a role in Perl regular expressions related 
        to E's <tt>@</tt>-holes: they extract the part of the specimen matched 
        against the sub-pattern they contain. To generate a proper Perl regular 
        expression, the "<tt>rx</tt>" wrapper removes the <tt>@</tt>-holes 
        leaving </p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>"a(.*?)d(.*)"</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">but verifies that each <tt>@</tt>-hole was at the beginning 
        of such a parenthesized group, and remembers which group it is. The (cached) 
        MatchMaker consists of a compiled Perl Pattern object plus the correspondence 
        between paren-group-number and <tt>@</tt>-number. On a successful 
        match it returns the bindings in a list ordered according to the original 
        <tt>@</tt>-numbers. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Unfortunately, to do this, "<tt>rx</tt>" must correctly 
        distinguish between an "<tt>(</tt>" that starts a Perl-saved-group 
        and one that doesn't. We currently impose some restrictions (reject some 
        valid Perl patterns) to make this recognition easier, but we still don't 
        always get this right. Fortunately, the known bugs here haven't yet bitten 
        anyone on any real examples, but this needs to be fixed. Ideally, the 
        OroMatcher code could be enhanced so "<tt>rx</tt>" could ask Pattern 
        where it thinks the open parens of save-groups are. I''ve asked oroinc/savarese.org 
        if they'd be interested it adding this query, and have yet to hear back.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The ORO website also provides a <a href="http://www.oroinc.com/developers/docs/OROMatcher/Syntax.html">good 
        quick reference</a> to Perl-5 regular expressions, and a link to the official 
        one.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">Beware Write-Only Code</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">I always hated a lot of Perl code for being so hard to read. 
        I took pride in how readable E was by comparison. That is, until I started 
        heavily using Regular expressions. My code became a dense gobbledygook 
        of punctuation characters that reminded several folks of APL. The answer 
        is not to give up on regular expressions. Rather the answer comes with 
        a new Perl-5 feature imported into E courtesy of the ORO folks: The &quot;<tt>(?x)</tt>&quot; 
        flag. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Put &quot;<tt>(?x)</tt>&quot; at the beginning of your 
        &quot;<tt>rx</tt>&quot; pattern and now you can freely embed whitespace 
        and &quot;<tt>#</tt>&quot; comments in your pattern. Of course, you 
        will then have to escape whitespace and &quot;<tt>#</tt>&quot; characters 
        that are supposed to be part of the pattern, but this is a small price 
        to pay. A good example of readable code using regular expressions can

      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="future"></a>Long Term Future Directions: Hypercard</h1>
      <p ALIGN="left">Our long term future takes us back to the conversation with 
        <a href="http://www.scottkim.com/">Scott Kim</a> that pointed us in this 
        direction long ago. Hypercard had just come out and was obviously powerful 
        in a way most of had not seen before. Scott had a unique perspective on 
        this power: </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Most programming languages have as literal data types things 
        like numbers, characters, and strings. Lisp, in addition, has lists, but 
        all these only express literals using text strings. Why? Because the program 
        itself is a text string. A weird pun is going on: when you put the insertion 
        point of your text editor between the quotes of a literal string you're 
        effectively no longer in a program editor, but in a nested text editor. 
        The text you are editing is -- almost -- simply the text that that literal 
        evaluates to. Whereas normally programming is indirect, here we're operating 
        by direct manipulation -- creating the actual output directly.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Hypercard is normally conceived of as primarily a visual 
        application builder with an embedded silly programming language (Hypertalk). 
        Think instead of a whole Hypercard stack as a mostly literal program. 
        In addition to numbers and strings, the literals you can directly edit 
        include bitmaps, forms, buttons, and menus. You can literally assemble 
        most things, but where you need dynamic behavior, there's a hole in the 
        literal filled in by a Hypertalk script. The program editor for this script 
        is experienced as being nested inside the direct manipulation user interface 
        editor.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">It's one of those 15 minute conversations that change your 
        life.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Though there have been many many visual interface builders 
        since Hypercard, I'm not aware of any that have pursued this analogy between 
        partially literal user-interface construction and Lisp quasi-quote. How 
        should E eventually pursue this?</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Well, we could get fancy and say that source code should 
        stop being text, and should instead be a graph of objects. Unfortunately, 
        though this approach has paid off in the past, it is becoming increasingly 
        less possible, as the world becomes increasingly more wedded to text. 
        (Overall net progress can obscure many cases of horrifying regress, and 
        the computer world is rife with them.) Fortunately, there's a low road:</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The Macintosh Resource Fork and ResEdit was a crude but 
        effective form for direct manipulation editing of an extensible set of 
        non-textual literal data types. They fell short of what we seek in only 
        two regards: 1) The literals weren't "quasi", ie, they were fully literal, 
        rather than having holes to be filled in by more code. 2) They weren't 
        meaningfully embedded within the program text -- not visually, and not 
        scoping-wise. As pure literals, the lack of scope embedding doesn't matter. 
        But once you fix #1 you must make sure the embedded expressions are in 
        their lexical context. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Elmer currently uses the Java Swing plain text editor, a 
        sibling of the Java Swing compound document editor (of which the wysiwyg 
        html editor is a subclass). Java also has a resource mechanism (which 
        I'd guess was inspired by the Macintosh's), and Java can serialize/unserialize 
        object graphs into such resources.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">A future E compound document editor could generate and recognize, 
        for example, the expression</p>
      <p ALIGN="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>reseditor`&lt;resource name&gt; foo=${expr0} bar=${expr1}`</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">unserialize the resource with this name into (hopefully) 
        a ValueMaker that's also an editable Model, and embed at this place in 
        the program editor a nested editor for this type of Model. Of course, 
        to preserve the quasi-literal illusion, the editor for the Model should 
        seem like the editor for the data type the ValueMaker makes (in response 
        to substitute()), but it would in turn contain embedded program editors 
        at the positions in the Model corresponding to the names "foo" and "bar". 
        Perhaps the literal plane should be shown above the program plane using 
        shadows. The embedded program editors would be shown, in wells using reverse 
        shadows, to be on the same plane (and so the same scope) as the surrounding 
        program. On "Save", the editor would serialize the ValueMaker back into 
        resource land.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Similarly, of course, for serialized MatchMakers.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Besides user interface construction, what would you use 
        this for? How about generating graphics? Right now, you can either write 
        computer graphics code, which is very indirect but very general; or use 
        a drawing program, which works great as long as what you're drawing fits 
        its limitations. What if you're not even trying to produce a single drawing, 
        but rather to produce a program that does data dependent drawing? Currently 
        you'd be stuck with a mostly indirect way of expressing yourself. It would 
        seem the ability to intimately mix elements expressed at different levels 
        of literalness could let us use the best of both on the same task.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Or (borrowing slightly from the Garden system) how about 
        embedding a graphical state diagram or state chart editor. The transition 
        arcs could have holes containing actions expressed in code that's in the 
        scope of the lexical context containing the embedded state diagram.</p>
