  Causeway: A post-mortem, distributed debugger</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Causeway 
  distributed debugger presents a distributed program as a tree of partially ordered 
  causal relations. Message sends are matched up with the corresponding receives 
  to support a <em>"follow the conversation"</em> approach to debugging asynchronous 
  message passing.</font></p>
<p align="left">Causeway is an open source distributed debugger written in E 
  using the tamed SWT GUI Toolkit. </p>
<p></p>
It is a post-mortem debugger for E programs that were run with causality tracing 
on. A distributed program will have multiple trace files trace files to create 
a partially ordered causality graph. a distributed, asynchronous message send 
can be easily followed across address-space boundaries follow the conversation 
these boundaries are crossed effortlessly

As the screenshot above shows, Causeway presents several different views of the causal relations. 
The views are coordinated such that, selecting an item in one view causes corresponding 
selections in other views. 
<p><u>Causality Tree View</u> This tree view contains the full graph built from 
  the trace files.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Pruned Causality Tree View</u> This tree view is built by walking the full 
  graph and applying a relevance function to each causal relation. The relations 
  are either clipped, skipped, or kept, depending on how relevant, or interesting, 
  they seem. Tree pruning is guided by relevance functions and filters. Currently, 
  default options are selected, but we expect to support user-defined functions 
  and filters in a future release. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Full-order View</u> The view to the left of the tree view lists the events 
  from a single trace file, in full order. This is equivalent to the full order 
  of events sent within a single process. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Stack Frame View</u> This view is not quite what you would expect. For a 
  selected message in the tree view, the stack shows the state at the time the 
  message was sent, not received. It's the stack of the cause, not the effect. 
  Selecting an item in the stack view shows the corresponding source code.<br>
  <br>
  <u>Source Code View</u> This view shows the filename and E source code, if available.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Generating causality traces</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> E supports 
tracing and there are many options for turning on various kinds of traces, generated 
at different levels of detail. The command below generates a causality trace of 
<tt>seller.e</tt>. 
<pre>          
    rune -DTraceLog_causality=debug $c/e/src/esrc/scripts/causeway/seller.e
</pre>
By default, trace files are written to an inconvenient place and given names that 
are difficult to work with. Use the <tt>TraceLog_dir</tt> property to change the 
output directory, then, after the trace has completed, rename the trace files 
to shorter, more memorable names. For example, <tt>etrace.2004-11-20T01_17_58.600Z.txt</tt> 
could be renamed to <tt>seller.txt</tt>. 
<pre>          
    -DTraceLog_dir=c:/etrace
</pre>
Make use of E's support for turning tracing on/off in your program. Bracket the 
code of interest with a call to turn tracing on and a call to turn tracing off. 
In the code below, the trace begins with the eventual send to <tt>x</tt> and ends 
when the promise to <tt>answer</tt> is resolved. The trace includes the message 
sends (effects) caused by <tt>x &lt;- question()</tt> (the cause) and the message 
sends caused by these effects, and so on. 
<pre>    
    # import tracing support
    def tcr := &lt;unsafe:org.erights.e.develop.trace.TraceController&gt;

    # &#8230;
	
    # turn causality tracing on
    tcr.setProperty(&quot;TraceLog_causality&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;)

    def answer := x &lt;- question()
    when (answer) -&gt; done(_) :any {
    } catch problem { 
        # &#8230;
    } finally {
        # turn causality tracing off
        tcr.setProperty(&quot;TraceLog_causality&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;)
    }</pre>
