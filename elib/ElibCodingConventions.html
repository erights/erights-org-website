      <h1>Communities.com Design Rules and Coding Conventions</h1>
      <i><b>Version 1.1, 21-April-1997</b> This page is maintained by Chip. </i> 
      <p> The following is the official set of design rules and coding conventions 
        which we will henceforth be using here at Communities.com. This is intended 
        to discipline us into writing better software. We have demonstrated by 
        the current state of things that we both lack this discipline and require 
        it. 
      <p> All of these rules are motivated by practical experience. However, they 
        are not set in concrete. Expect them to change and expand as we learn. 
        Your feedback in improving these rules is encouraged, nay, demanded. And 
        when you find it makes more sense to break one of these rules, break it 
        - but be conscious that you are doing so and that you have a good reason 
        you can articulate. 
      <p> These rules are not intended to harass you or make your life difficult; 
        quite the opposite. However, <i>I</i> will harass you and make your life 
        difficult if you don't start following them. 
      <p> First rule: regardless of whatever other rules you may be following 
        or not following, you must format neatly and consistently. 
      <p> Prefer small methods, small classes, shallow inheritance, small packages 
      <h2>Ordering</h2>
      Order your classes neatly when you have multiple classes in a file: public 
      before package scope, then interfaces before classes, then alphabetical 
      by class name. 
      <p> Order the things declared inside a class too: instance variables before 
        constructors before static methods before non-static methods, then public 
        before package before protected before private, then in alphabetical order 
        by name. 
      <h2>Scoping</h2>
      Always prefer the most restrictive scope that works. If a variable is only 
      used inside a block, declare it in that block. Take advantage of the fact 
      that, unlike C, Java lets you declare anywhere, not just at the top of a 
      block. Declare simple iteration variables in the <tt>for</tt> construct 
      if they're not used outside it: 
      <pre><tt>
    for (int i=0; i&lt;limit; ++i) { ...
</tt></pre>
      <p>No public instance variables, ever. Package scope instance variables 
        only under duress. 
      <p>No public mutable static variables, ever. Mutable static variables in 
        general should be avoided. Assume that statics can get reinitialized at 
        any time (under persistence, they can) - you can use statics for tracing, 
        caching, and diagnostics, but not for holding critical state. 
      <p>Import individual classes, not packages. That is, don't have imports 
        of the form: 
      <pre><tt>
import foo.bar.*;
</tt></pre>
      <h2>Naming</h2>
      Instance variables should have names of the form <tt>myFoo</tt>. In 
      addition to improving legibility, this convention has two other beneficial 
      consequences: First, it makes dealing with the no public instance variables 
      rule less burdensome, because you can (now by convention) name accessor 
      functions after the things they access, i.e., instead of: 
      <pre><tt>
    int getFoo() {
        return foo;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>you can say: 
      <pre><tt>
    int foo() {
        return myFoo;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>Second, constructors no longer have to dance around naming their parameters, 
        i.e., you can have a constructor like this: 
      <pre><tt>
    SomeClass(int foo) {
        myFoo = foo;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>instead of the somewhat awkward: 
      <pre><tt>
    SomeClass(int foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>or the truly evil (which I have seen in some of our code!): 
      <pre><tt>
    SomeClass(int Foo) {
        foo = Foo;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>Methods which implement boolean predicates should have names of the form 
        <tt>isFoo</tt>. That said, we have too many of these and often they 
        should be avoided (see below). 
      <h2>Symbol capitalization</h2>
      <p>midCaps: first letter of new English word always capitalized, even if 
        one letter. Underbars and dollar signs only in generated names. 
      <p>initial small: methods, non-static variables, package names 
      <p>Initial Cap: types (classes, interfaces), static variables. 
      <p>ALL_CAPS: manifest constants (<tt>static final int FOO = 47;</tt>). 
        Underbars as word separators but dollar signs only in generated names. 
      <h2>Indentation and brace formatting</h2>
      Use 4-space indents. Since Pluribus nests structures with wild abandon, 
      in Pluribus sources 2-space indents are the norm. 
      <p> However, the TAB character per se is BANNED. 
      <p>We will use the <i>one true brace</i>; style: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (cond) {
        stuff;
    }

    if (cond) {
        stuff;
    } else if (cond2) {
        morestuff;
    } else {
        evenmorestuff;
    }

    while (cond) {
        stuff;
    }

    do {
        stuff;
    } while (cond);

    switch (num) {
        case FIRST:
            stuff1;
            break;
        case SECOND:
            stuff2;
            break;
        default:
            stuffd;
            break;
    }

    try {
        stuff;
    } catch (AnExceptionClass e) {
        catchstuff;
    }

    public foo aMethod(AClass param1, AnotherClass param2) throws Foon {
        stuff;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>Use braces even if the consequent or loop body is one line. 
      <p>Never put conditions and their consequents on the same line: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (....) { y = f(x); }   // BAD
</tt></pre>
      <h2>Line breakage</h2>
      <p>Format lines to fit within 80-characters. First choice for breaking up 
        long lines is to indent so that parameters line up: 
      <pre><tt>
    somevar = methodCall(expr1,
                         innerCall(expr2,
                                   expr3),
                         expr4);
</tt></pre>
      <p>If this does not work (because you are already too deeply indented or 
        because expressions themselves are too complicated), break at a logical 
        point and then indent one level deeper than the start of the expression: 
      <pre><tt>
    somevar = reallyReallyReallyReallyLongMethodCall(longparameterexpr,
        extremelylonglonglongstuff, evenmorestuff, evenmoreevenlongerstuff,
        yetmorestuff);
</tt></pre>
      <p>The exception is when the thing being continued is itself a conditional 
        or a method declaration which itself would be followed by indented code. 
        In such cases the continuation should be indented two levels deeper. E.g.: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (aReallyLongPrettyComplicatedConditionalExpression &amp;&amp; anotherOne &amp;&amp;
            yetAnotherOne &amp;&amp; stillMore) {
        consequences;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <h2>Exceptions</h2>
      <p>Use exceptions. Don't write methods that indicate error conditions by 
        returning special values that have to be checked; have them throw exceptions 
        instead. 
      <p>Then catch these exceptions. 
      <p>Catch exceptions and handle them sensibly. 
      <p>Don't handle exceptions by simply discarding them. 
      <p>Don't handle exceptions by printing error messages and stack traces, 
        unless you KNOW you are in some reasonable context for doing so (e.g., 
        the top of a command-line interpreter loop). If you do handle exceptions 
        by printing error messages and stack traces, output them to System.err, 
        not System.out. 
      <p>Don't catch exceptions indiscriminately (e.g., don't catch <tt>Exception</tt> 
        unless you have a REALLY good reason). 
      <p>Note: a more comprehensive set of guidelines for exception usage will 
        be forthcoming, giving a taxonomy of exception types and principles for 
        their sensible enjoyment. 
      <h2>Irksome habits some people have</h2>
      <p>Throw and return statements should look like statements, not method calls: 
      <pre><tt>
    return aResult;
    throw new FoobarException(&quot;hey!&quot;);
</tt></pre>
      <p> not 
      <p> 
      <pre><tt>
    return(aResult);
    throw(new FoobarException(&quot;hey!&quot;));
</tt></pre>
      <p>Don't put spaces between a method name and the parameter list in either 
        calls or declarations: 
      <pre><tt>
    doFoobaration(47, mySnozzgrom);
</tt></pre>
      <p> not 
      <p> 
      <pre><tt>
    doFoobaration (47, mySnozzgrom);
</tt></pre>
      <p>Don't put spaces between a statement and its terminating semicolon. 
      <p>If you have a boolean flag that you are testing for falsehood, the test 
        is: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (!flag) { ...
</tt></pre>
      <p> not 
      <p> 
      <pre><tt>
    if (flag == false) { ...
</tt></pre>
      <p>Certainly you should use parentheses for disambiguating complex expressions, 
        but don't get all silly about it. Java/C/C++ operator precedence rules 
        may be a bit obtuse at times, but they're not crazy. Use parentheses on 
        the weird cases (e.g., the <tt>?:</tt> operator), but multiplication 
        does take precedence over addition, and comparison does take precedence 
        over and and or, and that's mainly what's important. My eyes hurt from 
        trying to parse conditionals which are illegible because every single 
        subexpression has been parenthesized: 
      <p>Use 
      <pre><tt>
    if (0 &lt; i &amp;&amp; i+1 &lt;= k+1 &amp;&amp; j == k-1) ...
</tt></pre>
      <p> or maybe 
      <p> 
      <pre><tt>
if ((0 &lt; i) &amp;&amp; (i+1 &lt;= k+1) &amp;&amp; (j == k-1)) ...
</tt></pre>
      <p> but not 
      <p> 
      <pre><tt>
if (((0 &lt; i) &amp;&amp; ((i + 1) &lt;= (k + 1))) &amp;&amp; (j == (k - 1))) ...
</tt></pre>
      <p>Avoid assignments within conditionals. They're too easy to misread. 
      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>Comment your code! And make the comments useful and accurate - which 
        means keeping them up to date. Don't forget that comments are not code; 
        the program doesn't execute them. If what the code does and what the comments 
        say it does are different, the result is bad confusion (by the way, bugs 
        in comments which you find should be reported to ec_bugs just like any 
        other). 
      <p>Don't write uncommented code with the intention of commenting it later. 
        Later usually doesn't come. Also, I've found that the mental discipline 
        of writing clear comments as you code actually increases significantly 
        the odds of producing bug free code on the first try. 
      <p>Comment for javadoc, even on private things. (Javadoc comments on private 
        things are currently ignored by javadoc but our soon-to-be-available edoc 
        tool will use this info, and human readers certainly can use this info 
        too). 
      <p>FYI, documentation on javadoc itself can be found at 
      <p><a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html">http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javadoc.html</a> 
      <p>Use HTML tags in your javadoc only very lightly, if at all, but do use 
        <tt>@param</tt>, <tt>@returns</tt>, etc. 
      <p>And make your makefiles have targets for running javadoc on your code. 
      <p>Use javadoc commenting conventions in C code too. It's a reasonable notation 
        for describing functions. And once you've developed the javadoc habit 
        from Java, using it in C too is quite a natural thing to do. When we have 
        a chance we'll produce a tool to process javadoc comments in C (and also 
        in E code that javadoc currently chokes on). 
      <p>Implementation comments are the non-javadoc ones. Use implementation 
        comments liberally. Always be skeptical as to whether something is self 
        evidently obvious. 
      <p>Use longer class, method, procedure and variable names in preference 
        to short names that require a comment to be comprehensible. In any case, 
        instance variable declarations should be accompanied by brief comments 
        stating what the variables are for. 
      <p>By convention, the easily-grepped-for string &quot;<tt>XXX</tt>&quot; 
        in a comment flags something demanding future attention. Use this for 
        things that should be taken out before ship (kind of like those big red 
        &quot;REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT&quot; tags on airplane parts), known hacks 
        that need to get fixed, questionable security situations that need to 
        be revisited, etc. 
      <p>Chip has also written up more extensive guidelines (XXX javadoc guidelines 
        not found) for using Javadoc at Communities.com. 
      <h2>Security and robustness </h2>
      <p>No public instance variables. 
      <p>No public mutable static variables. 
      <p>No static methods which confer authority (i.e., which let you effect 
        the state of the system or the outside world or which provide access to 
        objects that let you do this). 
      <p>Don't directly refer to Java library classes (such as <tt>java.io.FileOutputStream</tt>) 
        which statically confer authority, unless what you are doing is writing 
        a wrapper to protect other people from having to break this rule. Use 
        the <tt>EEnvironment</tt> to obtain access to privileged powers rather 
        than using class names. 
      <p>Avoid separation of designation from authority, even when you don't think 
        the authority concerns anything important. For example, don't create methods 
        where you indicate things via, say, string parameters that get looked 
        up in hashtables, if you can indicate things by passing objects that directly 
        embody the operations desired. 
      <p>More generally, try to program in an object-oriented style. This should 
        be one of those things that goes without saying, but experience shows 
        that it's not. 
      <p>In particular, don't write methods that take a string or a number that 
        is then used in a switch statement or cascaded-if to decide what to do 
        - just pass an object that KNOWS what to do; it's cleaner and more extensible. 
      <p>It's also generally bad to write predicate methods of the form <tt>isFoo</tt> 
        to determine if an object is a foo or not - usually being a foo means 
        that it supports some kind of foo operations, in which case this should 
        be reflected in the object's type and you should be able to test it with 
        the <tt>instanceof</tt> operator. 
      <p>Similarly, you generally shouldn't create objects with methods of the 
        form: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (iAmAFoo) {
        actOneWay;
    } else {
        actADifferentWay;
    }
</tt></pre>
      <p>This is what classes are for. If you really need to do a test of this 
        sort, the form is: 
      <pre><tt>
    if (someobj instanceof SomeKindOfFoo) ...</tt></pre>
