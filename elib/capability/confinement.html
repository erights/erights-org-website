      <p>In the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7EKeyKOS/Confinement.html">original
        paper</a> on the confinement problem (and <a href="http://www.radium.ncsc.mil/tpep/library/rainbow/NCSC-TG-030.html">Covert
        Channel Analysis</a>) is expressed purely in terms of the leakage of information,
        but as above, one may also reason about the leakage of authority. These
        two are usefully distinguished. The original paper likewise was concerned
        only about <i>leakage out</i>. In our framework, this is Alice's ability
        to constrain Bob from leaking information or authority out to his unconstrained
        collaborator, Mallet. It is useful to separately examine Alice's ability
        to constrain Bob from receiving information or authority from Mallet,
        ie, to prevent <i>leakage in</i> to Bob. </p>
      <p>Our understanding of how to solve confinement derives from the KeyKOS
        <a href="factory.html">Factory</a>. The KeyKOS Factory, as well as the
        confinement mechanisms of E and EROS, only directly prevents leakage of
        capabilities, and thereby would seem to prevent the leakage of authority.
        What about information? </p>
      <h1>Overt vs Covert Channels</h1>
      <p>In a pure capability system, all <i>overt</i> causality flows only along
        capabilities. In a pure system, a capability is the only overt channel,
        and confinement of all overt channels prevents the flow of overt information.
        What is overt causality? It is causality specified by the underlying computational
        model. A correct program, by definition, may only depend on overt causality
        for its correctness. Contrast:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>if (40 + 40 &lt; 50) { doSomethingBuggy() }</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>with</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>if (foo.hashCode() &lt; 50) { doSomethingBuggy() }</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>(Written under the assumption that Java's <tt>Object.hashCode()</tt>
        method is available in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. In fact it isn't for exactly the reason that
        it's a good example here.)</p>
      <p>The first program is not buggy, because we know it will not call <tt>doSomethingBuggy()</tt>,
        since the sum of <tt>40 + 40</tt> is guaranteed <i>by the specification</i>
        to be greater than <tt>50</tt>. One might like to say the second program
        is buggy, since it might call <tt>doSomethingBuggy()</tt>. But what
        if the author of the second program knows the enough about the implementation
        of the particular system this code will run on to know what hashCode will
        be assigned, and thereby knows that it's guaranteed, <i>by the implementation</i>
        to be less than <tt>50</tt>? We still define the program to be incorrect,
        because it is relying on <i>incidental</i> properties of the implementation
        that are outside the specified properties.</p>
      <p>Though we define the second program to be incorrect, the author, Mallet,
        still knows it will actually run correctly, so it may still suit his purposes.
        As long as it is possible for Mallet's programs to depend on incidental
        properties of a system, some of his programs may do so. Therefore, the
        security of Alice's programs may not depend on Mallet not exploiting incidental
        properties of a system. Can Alice do so, and have her security depend
        only on specified properties of the system? Only if the specification
        is tighter than is the normal computer science habit.</p>
      <p>Javasoft's specification of <tt>Object.hashCode()</tt> is <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()">here</a>. 
        Unsurprisingly, it does not determine what particular integer will be 
        returned under particular circumstances, though it does impose the set 
        of reasonable constraints one would expect from other object systems. 
        However, these constraints do not specify what information must not be 
        revealed. A peculiar but conforming implementation could read successive 
        locations of memory, and use their values as successive hashCodes. Under 
        such an implementation, Alice could not protect her secrets from Mallet. 
        For Alice's security to be <i>correct</i>, it must depend only on the 
        specification of the system, and therefore the specification must be tight 
        enough to prohibit, for example, such secret-revealing <tt>hashCode</tt> 
        implementations.</p>
      <p>A specification, like hashCode's, that leaves room for incidental implementation
        properties that computation can sense, is a <i>non-deterministic specification</i>.
        The causality of an implementation that computation can exploit, but that
        is outside of the specified causality of the system, is <i>covert causality</i>.
        To derive information from covert causality is to <i>read a covert channel</i>.
        To provide a covertly causal input that another can sense is to <i>write
        a covert channel</i>. Ideally the non-determinism allowed by the specification
        is constrained enough for Alice to be assured, by Factory-like mechanisms,
        that Bob and Mallet cannot covertly communicate. Unfortunately, such a
        strong specification can be very <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/KK/BangCap.html">difficult
        or costly to implement</a>, and neither KeyKOS, EROS, nor E attempt to
        do so.</p>
