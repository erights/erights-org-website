        <li> Does Bob wish to give Mallet the authority, despite Alice's wishes 
          to the contrary?</li>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <P ALIGN="left">The above links explain each of these cases, and examines 
        the differences in how Capabilities <i>vs.</i> Access Control Lists (ACLs) 
        address these issues. In summary 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p>Any security system must start by solving perimeter security. Capabilities 
            and ACLs build on the same solutions to this problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>ACLs have an <i>expressiveness hole</i> on confinement: not only 
            can they not enforce the needed prohibitions, they cannot even express 
            these prohibitions. Capabilities can easily express these prohibitions. 
            Capability systems can easily enforce a subset of these prohibitions 
            (capability confinement), and with great difficulty enforce the full 
            set of prohibitions.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>In an ACL system, when an agent engages in an action, all relevant 
            authority the agent posseses is implicity applied to determine whether 
            the action should be allowed. In a capability system, the authority 
            applied to an action is only the authority explicitly <i>brought to 
            bear</i> by the agent -- a subset of the authority possessed by the 
            agent. This is accomplished with no extra notation by combining <i>designation</i> 
            with <i>authority</i>. Only this latter discipline enables one to 
            write unconfusable deputies that can perform a reasonable range of 
            jobs.<br>
            Once one can write such unconfusable deputies, Mallet might still 
            be able to exploit bugs in Bob in order to confuse Bob into leaking 
            authority. ACL-like mechanisms can be used as reinforcements to make 
            such exploitability less likely for a certain class of bugs.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>Capabilities have an <i>expressiveness hole</i> on Communicating 
            Conspirators: They cannot express this prohibition, and therefore 
            they cannot enforce it. Unlike capabilities, ACLs can express this 
            prohibition. One may see this hole as the dual of the ACL/confinement 
            expressiveness hole. Can ACLs enforce this prohibition? No. In fact, 
            even with complete omniscience and omnipotence over the state of a 
            system, no force in the universe can enforce this prohibition, since 
            the only difference between what's allowed and what's prohibited is 
            how we choose to describe it.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Only Prohibit What You Can Prevent</h1>
      <p>Historically, capabilities have suffered in competition with ACLs because 
        of a perception that they were weaker than ACLs at expressing limits on 
        delegation. (ref Bobert, Gong, Wallach) As we've seen, the one place where 
        capabilites are indeed weaker at expressing a prohibition is the one case 
        where the prohibition is unenforceable -- indeed incoherent. ACLs, by 
        enabling such prohibitions to be expressed, only weakens security. By 
        leading users and programmers to make decisions under a <i>false sense 
        of security</i> about what others can be prevented from doing, ACLs seduce 
        them into actions that compromise their own security.</p>
      <p>By dividing up the issue of prohibiting delegation into these four categories, 
        we see that </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perimeter Security is neutral between the two, </li>
        <li> for Confinement and Confused Deputy capabilities have a strict expressiveness 
          and enforceability advantage over ACLs, </li>
        <li>and for Communicating Conspirators, capabilities have the advantage 
          of not expressing that which cannot be enforced.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This misunderstanding has misled the computer world into building ACL-based 
        systems for around 20 years (Unix, MacOS, Windows9x, WindowsNT). For capability 
        systems to catch on, they must be viable in an ACL-infested world. What 
        are the options for interfacing capability secure systems to a legacy 
        of ACL permissions? Answering this question should be a fruitful area 
        for research.</p>
      <h1>The Third School: Cryptography</h1>
      <p>Modern cryptography is creating a third school of computer security. 
        This school is characterized by</p>
      <ul>
        <li> the assumption that authority and identity are rooted in knowledge 
          of secrets, </li>
        <li> the requirement that all prohibitions be enforeable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We see a natural affinity between capabilities and modern cryptography. 
        Not only can capabilities be implemented cryptographically, but many (not 
        all) of the security relationships being explored by modern cryptography 
        can be naturally expressed in capabilities. The world of financial cryptography 
        has converged on <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/bearer_contracts.html">bearer 
        instruments</a>, almost by necessity given the above two principles. Capabilities 
        are a pure logic of bearer instruments. We expect interfacing capabilities 
        to modern cryptographic systems -- those founded on the above two principles 
        -- to generally be straightforward.</p>
      <p>We see no comparable affinity between ACLs and modern cryptography.</p>

      <h2><a name="assignment"></a>Is Delegation an &quot;Assignment of Rights&quot;?</h2>
      <p>What we refer to here as &quot;delegation of authority&quot; is in many 
        ways similar to what contract law would call &quot;assignment of rights&quot;. 
        An important difference is that, here, the acquisition of authority by 
        the delegatee does not normally imply the loss of that authority by the 
        delegator. By contrast, in contract law, the acquisition of rights by 
        the assignee does normally imply the simultaneous loss of that right by 
        the assignor. The Ode's <a href="ode/ode-bearer.html">taxonomy of kinds 
        of rights</a> refers to this as the distinction between <i>shared</i> 
        and <i>exclusive</i> rights. </p>
      <p>For controlling access to physical objects, it's easier to create a system 
        of exclusive rights, since they can be more easily moved than copied. 
        Electronic access control systems -- whether based on capabilities, ACLs, 
        or cryptographic protocols -- more easily support the creation of shared 
        access rights. The <a href="ode/index.html">Ode</a>, <a href="../../smart-contracts/index.html#ERTP">ERTP</a> 
        (see also <a href="../../talks/pisa/paper/index.html">The Digital Path</a>), 
        and the <a href="http://www.waterken.com/dev/IOU/Design/">Waterken IOU</a> 
        protocol show to build exclusive-rights transfer systems (one closer to 
        the conventional meaning of &quot;assignment of rights&quot;) as a layer 
        of abstraction on top of a system of capability-based shared-rights.</p>
      <p>We thank [<i>May I acknowledge you by name?</i>] for bringing both these 
        similarities and differences with contract law to our attention.</p>
