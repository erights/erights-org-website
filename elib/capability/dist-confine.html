      <P ALIGN="left">This chapter explains how one can confine distributed capabilities
        even when one can't outwardly confine bits.
      <h2>Full Confinement <i>vs</i>. Capability Confinement</h2>
      In a system in which capabilities are not <i>accessibly represented</i>
      as bits, the ability to outwardly leak bits does not enable the ability
      to leak capabilities. We first explore a single-machine pure capability
      system, such as the world of Java instances.
      <p><i>Accessible representation</i> can be illustrated by the Java object
        reference, which is implemented as just a 32-bit pointer. To Java objects,
        object references are completely opaque--even with knowledge of the 32
        bits that constitute a pointer (which can typically be obtained by <tt>Object.toString()</tt>),
        there is no operation for obtaining the corresponding pointer.
      <p>Assume four objects:
      <ol>
        <li> a confined object, Bob</li>
        <li> an unconfined conspirator, Mallet</li>
        <li> a customer of the confined object, Alice</li>
        <li> an authority-granting object, eg, an expense account</li>
      </ol>
      Alice gives Bob access to an object that provides some authority, such as
      an expense account. Alice has proper access to Bob, and Alice interacts
      with Bob counting on Bob's inability to interact with Mallet. Alice feels
      safe handing Bob the expense account since Bob is presumably confined. Alice
      is confident Bob can only spend the money on the things Bob may access within
      the confinement rules.
      <p>Mallet, not being confined, has a broader range of spending options available.
        Since Bob and Mallet are conspirators, if Bob <i>could</i> transmit the
        capability to spend to Mallet, he would do so. Covert channels do enable
        Bob to transmit bits to Mallet, but Bob cannot transmit an object reference
        to Mallet, even though the object reference is implemented only out of
        bits. This is an example of a defensible confinement claim in a system
        in which bits cannot be confined.
      <h2> Inward <i>vs.</i> Outward Bit Confinement</h2>
      &lt;need an explicit discussion of the differences>&nbsp;
      <hr>
      <h2> Distributed Capabilities</h2>
      Within a programming language's virtual machine or a single-machine operating
      system, there exists a special mechanism--the kernel--that sits underneath
      all of the participants and is mutually trusted. We use that special status
      to create a universe of capabilities among those participants. On an open
      network, on the other hand, there is no common mutually trusted mechanism.
      Therefore, distributed capabilities have to live within stricter constraints.
      Distributed capabilities on open networks can only be implemented cryptographically,
      and cryptography can only represent capabilities as bits. The bit representation
      of a capability is necessarily accessible to a machine participating in
      the network that holds that capability. Therefore, a machine on an open
      network cannot be fully confined or even be capability confined.
      <h2> Having <i>vs. </i>Knowing</h2>
      In cryptography, authorization is necessarily based on knowledge of secrets.
      Therefore, to have a right is only to know something, and knowledge of that
      secret thereby provides the right. In a pure capability system, on the other
      hand (such as the world of Java instances), <i>having</i> an object is absolutely
      different than <i>knowledge</i> of the object. It is novel to have such
      a distinction in computation because of the doctrine that within computation
      there is <i>only information.</i> However, in Java and in the physical world,
      no amount of <i>knowledge about </i>an object can provide <i>access to</i>
      the object.
      <p>This is the basic contrast between having and knowing, and between cryptography
        and pure capabilities.
      <h2> The Fallacy</h2>
      In the Pluribus network protocol a distributed capability is turned into a unguessable
      secret number, such that knowledge of the secret constitutes the ability
      to invoke the object. (A distributed capability also includes the fingerprint
      of the public key of the process hosting the object, but that is beyond
      the scope of this note.) Since the ability to invoke the object is simply
      secret <i>bits</i>, someone who knows that secret <i>can</i> choose to communicate
      it to anyone they wish. The na&iuml;ve conclusion is that one cannot capability-confine
      a distributed computation. Why might one think this?
      <p>In the network protocol capabilities are necessarily represented as bits.
        A distributed computation necessarily makes use of the network protocol.
        Therefore, the ability to leak bits would enable a distributed confined
        computation to leak these bits to a conspirator that can turn the bits
        back into a capability. Fortunately, there is a flaw in this reasoning.
      <h2> The Solution</h2>

      <center>
        Figure 1: Distributed Confinement
      </center>
      <p>What we have in Figure 1 is a confined Bob as an object graph distributed
        between machines A and B. (We call the part of Bob present on machine
        A <i>presence X</i>, and the part of Bob present on machine B <i>presence
        Y</i>.) The capabilities which cross between the machines are necessarily
        represented by bits accessible to the participating machines. The machines
        themselves are assumed to be mutually suspicious. Within the comm system
        bits and capabilities are interchangeable, therefore the comm system cannot
        be confined.
      <p>Given that machines A and B do in fact collaborate to confine the Bob,
        Bob cannot leak distributed capabilities over covert channels, even though
        the distributed capabilities would seem to be represented by unconfinable
        bits. Machines A and B deny to their respective parts of Bob knowledge
        of the bits that correspond to the remote capabilities they hold. However,
        the comm system <i>can</i> present to Presence X or Y <i>encapsulated
        proxies</i> that give the presence a capability designating a remote object
        while denying to the presence the knowledge of the secret number used
        to represent the capability on the network. As a result, Bob is a distributed
        computation that is in a distributed confinement box.
      <p>Machines A and B, and their respective comm systems, are playing by crypto
        rules where having and knowing are equivalent. However, they can still
        arrange to constrain Bob to play by pure capability rules where having
        and knowing are absolutely different.
