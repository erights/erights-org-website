      <p><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7EKeyKOS/">KeyKOS</a> was the first 
        system to demonstrate a solution to the confinement of authority, both 
        in and out. The KeyKOS solution is known as The Factory, and is also explained 
        <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/Conf.html">here</a> and in 
        the expired <a href="http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/KK/Patent.html">factory 
        patent</a>. The KeyKOS Factory is the most flexible known solution, in 
        that its provisions for <i>Sensory</i> capabilities and <i>Hole Checking</i>, 
        both explained below, allow a greater range of useful computation to be 
        confined than can be achieved without these provisions. 
      <p align="left"> 
      <p>In order to understand KeyKOS confinement, let's build up to it in stages. 
      <h3> Hypothetical Factory Design Stage #1: Bob is an Island</h3>
      <p> Mallet writes a proprietary program, BobProg, that he wishes to enable 
        Alice to use but not read. Alice wishes to use this program on proprietary 
        data of hers that she wishes Mallet not to read. Fortunately, they know 
        a trusted intermediary object, the FactoryFactory. Mallet hands the FactoryFactory 
        the compiled BobProg program + any initial pure data, asking it to make 
        a BobProgFactory, which he hands to Alice. The stage 1 factory accepts 
        only pure data from Mallet, not capabilities. 
      <p> Alice asks the FactoryFactory whether the BobProgFactory is indeed a 
        Factory (ie, something the FactoryFactory made). Assume the FactoryFactory 
        has some way of answering this question in a trustworthy fashion (this 
        is more of a <a href="ode/ode-capabilities.html#rights-amp">trick</a> 
        than it seems, but is true in KeyKOS, EROS, Joule, and E). Assured that 
        this is indeed a Factory of some sort, Alice asks it to produce its yield, 
        Bob. If you think of the factory as a class, Alice has asked for an instance 
        of the class. 
      <p> Bob starts with BobProg as its code + any initial pure data provided 
        by Mallet, but Bob has no initial capabilities other than those provided 
        by Alice in her instantiation request. Since Bob has no abilities to communicate 
        in or out, other than those provided by Alice, Alice considers Bob to 
        be confined. The "confinement check" in this story is simply the check 
        that BobProgFactory is indeed a Factory. 
      <p> In stage 1 Mallet provided data, but not the memory for the data. The 
        memory was allocated and written to once by the FactoryFactory in making 
        the BobProgFactory. Afterwards, this memory is exclusively held by BobProgFactory 
        and Bob, and never written to. Since Bob obeys the untrusted BobProg program, 
        either Bob is given a separate copy or read-only access to memory holding 
        BobProg. BobProgFactory's memory of BobProg is therefore effectively immutable. 
        If we ignore the deallocation issue, our stage 1 story provides both confinement 
        and durability. 
      <h3> Stage #2: Encapsulated Factory Graphs</h3>
      <p> Let's say Alice wishes to create a confined service for use by Carol 
        named Joe, just as Mallet has created a confined service for use by Alice 
        named Bob. However, the program Alice wishes to write makes use of the 
        functionality provided by BobProgFactory. Alice has no access to the BobProg 
        code, and so cannot incorporate it into the code used to make the JoeProgFactory. 
        In stage #2, we extend the description provided to the FactoryFactory 
        to make JoeProgFactory so it can contain references to other factories. 
        The Joes made by JoeProgFactory are then born with these as initially 
        accessible capabilities, and can use them to create confined objects it 
        can use. Just as Carol cannot read the code of JoeProg, Carol also cannot 
        find out that the Joes made by JoeProgFactory uses Bobs from BobProgFactory. 
        By the same token, Alice never knew whether Bobs from BobProgFactory's 
        uses yet other factories. 
      <p> The actual KeyKOS protocol doesn't provide the yield description all 
        at once in asking to create a factory. Rather, it first gets a blank factory, 
        then installs into it the description of the yield, and finally seals 
        it -- turning it into an instantiable factory. This has the advantage 
        that one can form cyclic encapsulated factory graphs. 
      <p> At this point, the one abstraction still provides both confinement and 
        durability. Confinement in E corresponds to stopping at stage #2. 
      <h3> Stage 3: Adding Sensory Capabilities </h3>
      <p> For now, see <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/CapTheory/KK/LaySense.html">this</a> 
        from Norm. I believe confinement in EROS corresponds to stopping at stage 
        #3. 
      <h3> Stage 4: Hole Checking &amp; Discretion</h3>
      <p> Alice doesn't necessarily care whether a Bob from BobProgFactory has 
        capabilities to non-confined entities. Rather, she cares whether these 
        objects have capabilities <i>other than those she approves of</i>. The 
        factory creation logic now allows Mallet to provide arbitrary capabilities 
        as the initial endowment of the yield of BobProgFactory, since these might 
        be ones that Alice does approve of. These capabilities which are not guaranteed 
        confined on previous grounds are called <i>holes</i>. 
      <p> To determine whether a yield/instance of BobProgFactory would be confined 
        <i>as far as she is concerned</i>, she performs a <i>hole check</i> on 
        BobProgFactory. A hole check involves a HoleChecker encapsulating a table 
        of approved holes. The HoleChecker implementation is <a href="ode/ode-capabilities.html#rights-amp">in 
        bed with</a> the Factory implementation, and in KeyKOS actually happens 
        to be a Factory. The hole check asks the question 
      <p> 
      <blockquote><i>Are there any holes in the transitive factory graph starting 
        at BobProgFactory not on the approved list?</i></blockquote>
      <p> The answer is only yes or no, because more detail would reveal too much 
        information. Since the question is now relative to an approved list, we 
        are no longer asking about an objective property of the factory. The <a href="../../history/joule/index.html">Joule</a> 
        language clarifies this by using "<i>confinement</i>" only for the objective 
        property (as dealt with in stages #1, #2, and #3) as opposed to "<i>discretion</i>" 
        for the more flexible relative property (as dealt with in stage #4). 
      <p> Since Alice has to provide the approved hole list, what generality is 
        lost if we skip discretion, and instead have Alice provide to Bob a name-table 
        of some sort from which Bob can obtain those holes Alice approves of? 
        Alice doesn't necessarily have access to the list of approved holes, merely 
        a HoleChecker that contains an encapsulated list. How can this come about? 
        The HoleChecker could have come from, for example, Alice's administrator. 
      <p>There's another problem with providing holes directly: Alice might be 
        willing for Bob to have certain holes only if Mallet had them and chose 
        to endow Bob with them. Though this problem is possible to solve without 
        hole checking, it is awkward. 
      <hr>
      <h1>Can We Do Less?</h1>
      <p> I asked Norm if the extra flexibility of hole checking, or discretion 
        over confinement, was ever useful in practice at KeyLogic or any of its 
        customers. If I recall, the answer was no. 
      <p>E doesn't have factories, sensory keys, or hole checking. Speaking somewhat 
        in advance of the current implementation, E instead has a set of declared 
        <i><a href="../../elang/same-ref.html">audited properties</a></i> of an 
        object expression. The property corresponding to the above stages #1 and 
        #2 is "transitively immutable". 
      <p> To declare an <a href="../../elang/kernel/ObjectExpr.html">object expression</a> 
        transitively immutable, the "transitive immutability" auditor must determine, 
        by examining the expression, that the object it evaluates to (instantiates) 
        cannot change its own state, and can only contain references to instances 
        of object expressions that are themselves declared transitively immutable. 
        An instance of an object expression that has passed this audit is itself 
        marked as having the audited property. Given such an instance, one can 
        ask an auditor whether it carries that auditor's mark. (Implementationally, 
        the mark will be on the object's vtable rather than the object.) 
      <p> Inter-Vat references and external I/O or device capabilities are not 
        considered immutable. With these definitions, a transitively immutable 
        object is like a confined and durable factory, corresponding to stages 
        #1 and #2. The same transitive auditing &amp; marking logic plausibly 
        could give us checkable sensory capabilities, taking us into stage #3, 
        but first I'd like to hear a case that we'll need those. I'd love for 
        "transitive immutability auditors" to be all the TCB support for confinement 
        we need. </p>
      <p> Unfortunately, <a href="dist-confine.html">Distributed Confinement</a> 
        seems to require the subjectivity of discretion. If Alice is running on 
        Machine A, then Bob is confined <i>as far as Alice is concerned</i> only 
        to the extent Alice trusts the confinement-checking agent (FactoryFactory 
        for KeyKOS, auditor for E) on Machine B to be doing its job as well. Such 
        issues didn't come up in KeyKOS because certain single objects, like the 
        FactoryFactory, could be assumed to be (approximately) universally known 
        and trusted. The distributed nature of E prevents it from relying on any 
        universally trusted objects.</p>
