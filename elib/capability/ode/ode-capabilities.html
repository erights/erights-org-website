      <h2><a name="cap-os"></a>Capability Operating Systems</h2>
      <p>The <i>capability</i> was first invented by secure operating system designers.
        It started as a way to protect &quot;primitive&quot; resources such as
        memory segments [<a href="ode-references.html#Dennis66">Dennis66</a>],
        but was soon generalized [<a href="ode-references.html#Wulf74">Wulf74</a>]
        into a protected ability to invoke arbitrary services provided by other
        processes. For each process, there is a table associating small numbers
        (similar in spirit to Unix file descriptors) with the capabilities held
        by that process. These small numbers serve the same function as variable
        names do in the lambda calculus [<a href="ode-references.html#Rees96">Rees96</a>].
        In a pure capability operating system, such as KeyKOS [<a href="ode-references.html#Hardy85">Hardy85</a>]
        or EROS [<a href="ode-references.html#Shapiro99">Shapiro99</a>], a process's
        only source of authority is the capabilities that it holds.
      <p>A capability is normally thought of as a pairing of a designated process
        with a set of services that the process provides. For example, in KeyKOS
        a capability carries a numeric tag which an invoked process receives along
        with an incoming message. The process then typically dispatches to a specific
        method based on both the numeric tag and the KeyKOS equivalent of a message
        name. The equivalence with objects is clear: the behavior looked up in
        this way, paired with the process-state, is the same sort of state-and-behavior
        that defines an object. When different capabilities make different behaviors
        from the same process available via different numeric tags, we can view
        the process as a composite and each of its capabilities as a facet.
      <h2><a name="patt-coop"></a>Patterns of Cooperation Without Vulnerability</h2>
      <p>The capability model is, in a sense, the object model taken to its logical
        extreme. Where object programmers seek modularity -- a decrease in the
        dependencies between separately thought-out units -- capability programmers
        seek security, recognizing that required trust is a form of dependency.
        Object programmers wish to guard against bugs: a bug in module A should
        not propagate to module B. Capability programmers wish to guard against
        malice. However, if B is designed to be invulnerable to A's malice, it
        is likely also invulnerable to A's bugs.
      <p>Historically, although capability programmers have created stronger modularity
        in this sense, they have harvested fewer of modularity's benefits. Object
        programmers have explored <i>patterns</i> [<a href="ode-references.html#Gamma95">Gamma95</a>]
        -- a taxonomy of stereotyped arrangements of abstractions that successfully
        work together. These abstractions work well together because the modularity
        boundaries between them aid their combination rather than obstructing
        it. In unifying the object paradigm with the capability paradigm, we hope
        to see a growing taxonomy of <i>patterns of cooperation without vulnerability</i>
        -- stereotyped arrangements in which mutually suspicious, separately interested
        agents may work together safely to achieve diverse goals. This paper explains
        a few such patterns.
      <p>So how do we get from objects to capabilities? It suffices to prohibit
        certain deviations from pure object computation. (It is also convenient,
        though not essential, to add a <i>rights amplification</i> primitive as
        explained below.) What are these new prohibitions?
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="begets"></a>Only Connectivity Begets Connectivity</b>.
            Consider all the ways Bob can obtain access to Carol. Only four possibilities
            are allowed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="by-intro"></a>Connectivity by Introduction</b>. Somebody
                sends Bob a reference to Carol, as shown in the Granovetter Diagram
                -- If Bob and Carol already exist, this is the only way Bob can
                obtain access: via a third party, such as Alice, under the three
                conditions stated <a href="overview.html#perspective-caps">in
                the <b>Perspectives</b> section above</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="by-parent"></a>Connectivity by Parenthood</b>. If
                Bob already exists and Carol does not, Bob may create Carol. Any
                object system must have an object creation primitive. Should Bob
                use this primitive to create Carol, Bob then has the <i>only</i>
                reference to Carol, unless and until he sends this reference to
                someone else. In the earlier example of a <tt>makePoint</tt> creating
                a point, the <tt>makePoint</tt> function at that moment has exclusive
                access to the new point.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> <b><a name="by-endow"></a>Connectivity by Endowment</b>. If
                Carol already exists and Bob does not, and if Bob's creator has
                access to Carol at the time of Bob's creation, Bob may be created
                sharing this access -- In essence, Bob is born holding a reference
                to Carol. Refering again to the <tt>makePoint</tt> example, the
                <tt>makePoint</tt> function, with access to <tt>x</tt> as a parameter,
                creates a new point that has access to <tt>x</tt> as part of its
                initial endowment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="by-bigbang"></a>Connectivity by Initial Conditions</b>.
                Capabilities explain how connectivity in an already connected
                system evolves over time. For any system <i></i> of objects to
                which we apply this analysis, there is some earliest state of
                the system that is our starting point. Bob and Carol may both
                already exist and already be connected in this earliest state.
                Without this case, one cannot bootstrap the others.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Languages that satisfy these constraints are sometimes called <i>memory-safe
            languages. </i>Object systems with garbage collection depend on this
            property to enable garbage collection to be semantically transparent.
            Since a disjoint subgraph cannot become reconnected, its storage may
            be silently recycled. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="encap"></a>Absolute Encapsulation</b>. From outside an
            object, one must not be able to gain access to the object's internals
            without the object's consent, even if one has a reference to the object.
            For operating systems, this corresponds to the separation of processes,
            and is quite common (even if imperfect) outside of capability operating
            systems. For example, operating systems often control a computer's
            memory management hardware so that one process cannot read or write
            another's address space or access its (for example) file descriptors,
            even if the two processes are communicating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="ref-only"></a>All Authority Accessed Only by References</b>.
            The authority an object has to affect or be affected the world outside
            of itself should be exactly represented by the references it holds.
            All primitives for interacting with the external world must be embodied
            by primitive objects, and one must obtain references to these primitive
            objects in order to exercise the associated primitive functions. Anything
            globally accessible must therefor be transitively immutable, otherwise
            it would constitute an unconditional source of authority not controlled
            by the reference-passing rules [<a href="ode-references.html#Kahn88">Kahn88</a>,
            <a href="ode-references.html#Rees96">Rees96</a>].</p>

      <h2><a name="rights-amp"></a>Rights Amplification</h2>
      <p><img src="images/rights-amp.gif" width="290" height="322" align="right" alt="Opening a can of Tuna">There 
        is one feature that most capability systems provide as a primitive but 
        which is not motivated solely from pure object programming -- rights amplification. 
        With rights amplification, the authority accessible from bringing two 
        references together can exceed the sum of authorities provided by each 
        individually. The classic example is the can and the can-opener -- only 
        by bringing the two together do we obtain the food in the can. 
      <p>Two common forms of rights amplification are sibling communication [<a href="ode-references.html#Hardy">Hardy</a>,
        <a href="ode-references.html#Gosling96">Gosling96</a>, <a href="ode-references.html#Shalit96">Shalit96</a>]
        and sealer/unsealer pairs [<a href="ode-references.html#Morris73">Morris73</a>,
        <a href="ode-references.html#Miller87">Miller87</a>, <a href="ode-references.html#Tribble95">Tribble95</a>
        <a href="ftp://www.agorics.com/pub1/agorics/postscript/MANUAL.B17.ps.Z">Appendix
        D</a>, <a href="ode-references.html#Rees96">Rees96</a>]. E primitively
        provides sealer/unsealer pairs. The money example below builds sibling
        communication from sealer/unsealer pairs.
      <p>Sealer/unsealer pairs are similar in concept to public/private key pairs. 
        The sealer is like an encryption key, and the unsealer like a decryption 
        key. The provided primitive, <tt>makeBrandPair</tt>, makes and returns 
        such a pair. When the sealer is asked to seal an object it returns an 
        envelope which can only be unsealed by the corresponding 
        unsealer.

      <p>If the envelope is the can and the unsealer is the can-opener (specific
        to this brand of cans), then <tt>Tuna</tt> is the food. <i>(The name-string

      <h2> <a name="simple-money"></a>Simple Money</h2>
      <p>Before presenting the following simple example of capability-based money,
        we must attempt to head off a confusion this example repeatedly causes.
        <b><i><font color="#FF0000">We are not proposing to actually do money
        this way!</font> </i></b>A desirable money system must also provide for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>blinding, to maintain the anonymity of cash [<a href="ode-references.html#Chaum82">Chaum82</a>],
        </li>
        <li>non-repudiation, i.e., reliable receipts [<a href="ode-references.html#Rivest77">Rivest77</a>],
        </li>
        <li>accounting controls, so the mint (issuer) can be caught if it cheats
          [<a href="ode-references.html#Bodnar87">Bodnar87</a>], </li>
        <li>and backing (redeemability) by assets that are already widely valued
          [<a href="ode-references.html#e-gold">e-gold</a>]. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following money provides none of these. Nevertheless, this simple
        money is a wonderful small example of the directness and simplicity with
        which capabilities allow the expression of <a href="index.html"> </a>
        arrangements in which mutually suspicious parties can cooperate safely.
      <p>The following code is somewhat more nested than you may be used to. The
        outer function, <tt>makeMint</tt>, makes <tt>mint</tt>s. Each <tt>mint</tt>
        defines a separate currency that isn't directly convertible with other
        currencies -- although, of course, money changers could trade one for
        the other, providing indirect convertibility. A <tt>mint</tt> can make
        <tt>purse</tt>s that hold new units of its currency, thereby inflating
        that currency. A <tt>purse</tt> can report its <tt>balance</tt> and make
        a new empty <tt>purse</tt> of the same currency. Given two <tt>purse</tt>s
        of the same currency, you can <tt>deposit</tt> money into one from the
        other.&nbsp;

        to avoid the cost of a runtime check, and to provide the programmer with

      <p>Then, we send a <tt>foo</tt> request to Bob, providing the purse containing
        $10 as payment:</p>
        
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdin">bob.foo(..., paymentForBob, ...)</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <table width="30%" align="right" cellspacing="12">
          <tr>
            <td><p><img src="images/money.png" width="316" height="298" alt="Money Transfer"></p>
              
            <p><i>(Although it may not be obvious, the three downward arrows refer 
              to three different purses.)</i></p></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <p>What might Bob's foo method look like?</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">Bob</span> {
    ...
    <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="defverb">foo</span>(<span class="defvar">...</span>, <span class="defvar">payment</span>, <span class="defvar">...</span>) ... {
        bobMainPurse.deposit(10, payment)
        <span class="comment"># proceed only if we got $10</span>
        ...
    }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      So playing Bob, we perform
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="stdin">bobMainPurse.deposit(10, paymentForBob)</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Our new balances are</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="stdin">bobMainPurse.getBalance()</span>
<span class="stdout"># value: 10
 
? </span><span class="stdin">aliceMainPurse.getBalance()</span><span class="stdout">
# value: 990</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This last <tt>deposit</tt> operation is key. Its success assures Bob
        that his main purse has been credited with $10. Under all other conditions
        it must fail. Under <i>all</i> conditions, the integrity of the money
        system must be conserved. All this despite the use of the payment parameter
        which, since it was received from an untrusted source, may be any arbitrary
        object. The <tt>deposit</tt> method must verify that the <tt>src</tt>
        purse is a purse of the same currency, and if so, that it has adequate
        funds to cover the transfer. If so it must decrement the <tt>src</tt>
        purse's <tt>balance</tt> by this amount and increment its own <tt>balance</tt>
        by that same amount. The problem? How can we allow the <tt>src</tt> purse
        to be told to decrement its <tt>balance</tt> by a sibling purse (one of
        the same currency), but not allow a client of the purse, such as Alice,
        to violate conservation of currency by making the same request? Conversely,
        how can we prevent Alice from providing a bogus purse that claims it has
        decremented itself, only to fool Bob's purse into incrementing itself
        at no cost to Alice?</p>
      <p>In the <tt>deposit</tt> method, the payment is bound to the <tt>src</tt>
        parameter and the following body is executed:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>unsealer.unseal(src.getDecr())(amount)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This asks the <tt>src</tt> purse for its <tt>decr</tt> function. A purse
        implemented by the above code will return an envelope containing the <tt>decr</tt>
        function and sealed with the sealer of its creating mint. Other objects
        might return anything. Whatever we get back from <tt>getDecr</tt> we then
        unseal with the unsealer of our creating mint. This will succeed only
        if the argument is an envelope sealed with the corresponding sealer. One
        can only get such an envelope from a purse created by the same mint, and
        therefor of the same currency. Otherwise it will throw an exception, preventing
        further action.</p>
      <p>If we succeed at unsealing, we know we have a <tt>decr</tt>-function
        facet of some purse of the same currency. We call it with the amount to
        transfer. Its <tt>amount</tt> parameter is declared:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="defvar">amount</span> :(0..balance)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>which only binds to the argument if the argument is between <tt>0</tt>
        and <tt>balance</tt>. Otherwise, the attempted parameter binding throws
        an exception. Finally, only if the call to the hidden <tt>decr</tt> function
        succeeds do we increment our own balance.</p>
      <p>Notice how the scoping rules together with the capability rules allow
        us to &quot;prove&quot; many security properties through a simple visual
        inspection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>By scanning for all occurrences of <tt>sealer</tt> and <tt>unsealer</tt>,
          we can quickly determine that they never escape from the mint and purses
          of their creating currency.</li>
        <li>Since the sealer is only used to seal the <tt>decr</tt> function,
          a successful unseal can only result in a <tt>decr</tt> function of the
          same currency.</li>
        <li>By scanning for all occurrences of <tt>decr</tt>, we see that it can
          only escape sealed in an envelope. Since the unsealer cannot escape,
          the sealed <tt>decr</tt> can only appear as the result of visible unseal
          operations. Since this unseal-result is only invoked and never sent
          in a message, <tt>decr</tt> cannot escape. </li>
      </ul>
