	<p>(footnote: The remaining feature often thought
        to be defining of object-oriented programming is
        inheritance. Though we do not view inheritance as as a
        fundamental ingredient of object computation, its widespread
        use in object-oriented programming practice motivates its
        inclusion in E.  However,

        of inheritance with capability security principles [<a

      <h2 align="left"><a name="lambda"></a>Lambda Abstraction</h2> 
      <p
      align="left">Lambda abstraction [<a
      href="ode-references.html#Church41">Church41</a>] is a pure
      theory of nested function definition and application. In E
      notation, conventional function definition and application
      should look familiar:

      <p> The only unfamiliar element is the use of
      &quot;<tt>:any</tt>&quot; as a
      <i>result guard declaration</i>. The value returned is filtered
      through the optional result guard. Like a traditional type
      declaration, a guard determines what kind of values may pass
      through. The &quot;<tt>any</tt>&quot; guard allows any value to
      be returned, whereas the &quot;<tt>void</tt>&quot; guard always
      returns <tt>null</tt>. As we will see, <i><b><font
      color="#009000">E</font></b></i> also allows optional guard
      declarations on variable definitions.</p>

      <p>Nested function definition, familiar from all lexical lambda
        languages including ALGOL60, Scheme, and ML, should also look
        familiar:</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>The call to <tt>makeAddr</tt> returns a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)">closure</a> 
        -- effectively a version of the <tt>adder</tt> function that adds <tt>3</tt> 
        to its argument. Church originally thought about this as substitution 
        -- return an <tt>adder</tt> function in which <tt>x</tt> has been replaced 
        by <tt>3</tt>. Unfortunately, this simple perspective generalizes poorly. 
        An alternative perspective is to consider a function, such as that held 
        in the <tt>addThree</tt> variable, to be a combination of a <i>behavior</i> 
        -- the static code for adder, and <i>state</i> -- the runtime bindings 
        for its <i>free</i> variables. <tt>x</tt> in <tt>adder</tt> is a free 
        variable in that <tt>adder</tt> uses <tt>x</tt>, but the corresponding 
        definition of <tt>x</tt> is inherited from <tt>adder</tt>'s creating context. 
        In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to such free state variables 
        as <i>instance variables</i>. 
      <p>Such functions already have the most often cited attribute of
        objects: they are a combination of encapsulated state together
        with behavior that has exclusive access to that
        state. Ignoring for a moment the message-name "<tt>foo</tt>",
        the Granovetter Diagram describes an important aspect of the
        lambda calculus. Imagine that Alice, Bob, and Carol are three
        functions. If, in the initial conditions, Alice contains a
        binding for Bob and Carol, then Alice's behavior can give Bob
        access to Carol.

      <h2 align="left"><a name="dispatch"></a>Adding Message Dispatch</h2>

      <p>The most visible difference between a function and an object
        is that a function's behavior is written to satisfy just one
        kind of request, and all calls on that function are forms of
        that one request. By contrast, an object's behavior enables it
        to satisfy a variety of different requests (each with a
        separate <i>method</i>). A request to an object (a
        <i>message</i>) identifies which of these requests is being
        made. There is nothing fundamental here; objects have been
        trivially built from functions, and vice-versa, many times in
        the history of computer science. In <i><b><font
        color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        behaviors-as-bundles-of-methods and requests-as-messages are
        the more primitive notions, of which functions are a
        degenerate case.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>From a lambda-calculus perspective, <tt>makePoint</tt> is
        like <tt>makeAddr</tt> -- it is a lexically enclosing function
        that defines the variable bindings used by the object it both
        defines and returns. From an object perspective,
        <tt>makePoint</tt> is simultaneously like a class and
        constructor -- both defining the instance variables for
        points, and creating, initializing, and returning individual
        points. We have found such lambda-based object definition to
        be simpler, more expressive, and more intuitive, than either
        of the common choices -- class-based and prototype-based
        object definition.  The lambda-based technique for defining
        objects dates back at least to 1973 [<a
        href="ode-references.html#Hewitt73">Hewitt73</a>], so we find
        it distressing that the other two are often assumed to be the
        only available choices.</p>

      <p>The returned points are clearly object-like rather than
        function-like.  Each point's behavior contains four methods --
        <tt>__printOn</tt>, <tt>getX</tt>, <tt>getY</tt>, and
        <tt>add</tt> -- and every request to a point starts by naming
        which of these services is being requested. Now we see that
        the "<tt>foo</tt>" in the Granovetter Diagram is simply a
        message-name.  Extending our earlier example, Alice's behavior
        would be:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre>        bob.foo(..., carol, ...)</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Some shortcuts above need a brief explanation. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>&quot;<tt>a + b</tt>&quot; is merely syntactic shorthand
            for &quot;<tt>a.add(b)</tt>&quot;, and similarly for other
            expression operators.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The command line interpreter prints a value by sending it
            the <tt>__printOn</tt> message. </p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>The string between back-quotes and containing $-prefixed
            expressions is a quasi-string. Like interpolated strings
            in Perl, it evaluates to a string by evaluating the nested
            expressions and printing them into the enclosing
            string. </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Finally, functions are simply one-method objects where
            the method is named &quot;<tt>run</tt>&quot;. The previous
            <tt>makeAddr</tt> is therefor just syntactic shorthand
            for:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="side-effects"></a>Adding Side Effects</h2>

      <p>Two features of object programming implied by the Granovetter
        Diagram have been left out of computation as so far
        described. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>

          <p>First, the diagram implies that Bob is obtaining access
            to Carol, but computation as so far described gives Bob no
            means for holding on to this access. </p>

        </li>
        <li>

          <p>Second, we understand the diagram to say that Alice is
            giving Bob access to Carol herself, not a copy of Carol
            [<a href="ode-references.html#Deutsch99">Deutsch99</a>].
            However, in computation as has been described so far,
            Carol is indistinguishable from a copy of Carol. We cannot
            distinguish between pass-by-reference-sharing and
            pass-by-copy, but the Granovetter Diagram clearly intends
            to show specifically pass-by-reference-sharing. Were
            computation adequately described purely in terms of
            pass-by-copy, the Granovetter Diagram would be
            unnecessary. </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The introduction of side effects solves both of these
      problems.</p>

      <p>Starting with lambda calculus (or with lambda plus message
        dispatch), there are many ways to add side effects. The
        approach used by <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        Scheme, ML and many other lambda languages is to introduce
        assignment.  In <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        variables are non-assignable (or
        &quot;<i><tt>final</tt></i>&quot;) by default. For a variable
        to be assignable, it must be declared with
        &quot;<i><tt>var</tt></i>&quot;.</p>

      <p>How does assignment make Carol potentially distinct from a
        duplicate of Carol? Consider:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="comment"># E sample</span>
<span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">makeCounter</span>(<span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="defvar">count</span>) :any {
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">counter</span> {
        <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="defverb">incr</span>() :any { <span class="keyword">return</span> count += 1 }
    }
    <span class="keyword">return</span> counter
}
</pre>

<pre><span class="stdout">? </span><span class="stdin"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defvar">carol</span> := makeCounter(0)</span>
<span class="stdout"># value: &lt;counter&gt;

? </span><span class="stdin">carol.incr()</span><span class="stdout">
# value: 1</span></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Two otherwise identical counters are distinct because they
        have distinct <tt>count</tt> variables that increment
        separately. All those who have access to the same counter are
        able to see the side effects of <tt>incr</tt> messages sent by
        others who have access to this same counter.</p>

      <p>How does assignment enable Bob to retain access he has been
        given to Carol? By assigning an incoming message-argument to
        an instance variable:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">makeBob</span>() :any {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> <span class="defvar">carol</span> := null
    <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="defobj">bob</span> {
        <span class="keyword">to</span> <span class="defverb">foo</span>(<span class="defvar">...</span>, <span class="defvar">newCarol</span>, <span class="defvar">...</span>) ... {
            carol := newCarol
        }
        ...
    }
    <span class="keyword">return</span> bob
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <h2><a name="facets"></a>Composites &amp; Facets</h2>

      <p>Technically, by introducing assignment, we have made each
        assignable variable into a distinct primitive variable-object,
        referred to as a <tt><i>Slot</i></tt>.  A user-defined object
        then contains bindings from the names of these variables to
        these Slots. The Slots in turn contain the bindings to the
        current values of the variables. When the programmer writes a
        use-occurrence of the variable in an expression, this causes
        the containing object to send a <tt>getValue()</tt> message to
        the Slot to get its current value. When the programmer writes
        an assignment, this causes the containing object to send a
        <tt>setValue(newValue)</tt> message to the Slot.</p>

      <p>When a variable is only in the scope of one object, as in all
        the above examples, we usually ignore this distinction, and
        speak as if the containing object has bindings directly from
        the variable names to the current values of these
        variables. But this shortcut does not work for code such
        as:</p>

      <p>Each time <tt>makeCounterPair</tt> is called, it defines a
        new <tt>count</tt> variable and returns a list of two objects,
        one that will increment and return the value of this variable
        and one that will decrement and return it. This is a trivial
        example of a useful technique -- defining several objects in
        the same scope, each providing different operations for
        manipulating a common state held in that scope. </p>

        refer to <tt>makeCounterPair</tt>, so there's no arrow to
        it. On the right, each triple is visualized as a single
        composite. This view also shows that <tt>makeCounterPair</tt>
        is in scope during the definition of each composite, and so
        they <i>might</i> reference it. </p>

      <p>Like an individual object, a composite is a combination of
        state and behavior. Like an individual object, the state
        consists of all of the variables within the composite. The
        behavior consists of all of the code within the composite, but
        here we have an important difference. </p>

      <p>The behavior elicited by a message to the composite depends
        not just on the message, but, obviously, on which object of
        the composite receives the message. Objects on the surface of
        the composite -- objects which may be referred to from outside
        the composite, like <tt>upCounter</tt> and
        <tt>downCounter</tt> -- are
        <i>facets</i> of the composite. The variable-object,
        <tt>count</tt>, need not be considered a facet since we can
        tell that no reference to it can escape from the
        composite.</p>

      <p>The aggregation of a network of objects into a composite is
        purely subjective -- it allows us to hide detail when we
        wish. The technique works because the possible interactions
        among composites obey the same rules as the possible
        interactions among individual objects -- these rules are
        therefor
        <i>compositional</i>. </p>

      <h2><a name="dyna-graph"></a>The Dynamic Reference Graph</h2>

      <p>When speaking of object computation, all too much emphasis is
        often placed on the objects themselves. The fabric of an
        object system is the dynamic reference graph. As suggested by
        the Granovetter Diagram, objects (or composites) are the nodes
        of this graph and references are the arcs. Only computation
        <i>within</i> the graph brings about changes to the topology
        of the graph (the <i>who refers to whom</i> relationships),
        and it only brings about those changes that are enabled by the
        graph's current topology.  To learn the perspective of the
        Granovetter Diagram is to see the dynamic reference graph as
        primary, and objects themselves as secondary [<a
