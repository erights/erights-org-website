      <p><img src="images/spki.png" width="339" height="195" align="right" alt="SPKI Diagram">It 
        is illuminating to compare and contrast the properties of the capability 
        model, as outlined above, with those of a public key infrastructure. For 
        concreteness, we will examine SPKI (RFC2693) [<a href="ode-references.html#Ellison99">Ellison99</a>] 
        since it has the most capability-like protocol, though all the functions 
        we will discuss can be performed by suitable use of the facilities provided 
        by X.509 version 3 [<a href="ode-references.html#Ellison99">Ellison99</a>]. 
        SPKI is concerned with the specification and transfer of <i>authorizations</i>. 
        Examples of these authorizations include such things as the ability to 
        access an FTP directory, use a network printer, or logon to a remote system. 
      </p>
      <p> In SPKI, the entity wishing to transfer an authorization, called the 
        Issuer, signs a <i>certificate</i> which specifies the public key of the 
        Issuer, the public key of the Subject, the Authorization, the validity 
        period, and an admittedly unenforceable [<a href="ode-references.html#Ellison99">Ellison99</a> 
        section 4.1.4] indication of whether the Subject may further delegate 
        the authorization. When the Subject wishes to exercise an authorization, 
        it presents a chain of certificates to a verifier, which checks the signatures 
        and verifies that the Subject holds the private key corresponding to the 
        public key specified by the certificate; this ensures that the Subject 
        has received the authorization from an authorized issuer. 
      <p> When we look at the Granovetter Diagram for a public key infrastructure, 
        we notice that there are some significant differences from the diagram 
        for a capability system. The most obvious is that there is no direct link 
        between the Issuer and the Subject. The SPKI authorization could be anonymously 
        posted to a USENET newsgroup or sent through an anonymous remailer. Because 
        the Subject identifies itself by possessing the private half of a public/private 
        key pair, the Issuer only needs to sign the certificate and publicly post 
        it. The entire process can take place offline. Except for maintaining 
        the secrecy of the private keys, secrecy is not needed to protect the 
        rights transfer. All communications can be "in the clear". There is no 
        way of confining the Issuer, to limit the entities that it can authorize. 
        The lack of a line between Issuer and Subject in the diagram reflects 
        this situation. 
      <p> Another difference is that the resource need not be an object. The verifier 
        which checks the authorization acts as a gatekeeper, in the same way that 
        Pluribus acts as a gatekeeper to distributed E objects. However, the authorizations 
        can be interpreted using conventional access control techniques. 
      <p> In an SPKI system, auditing who performed an action and who authorized 
        it fall naturally out of the public key structure. The auditor needs only 
        to record the public keys of the issuer and the subject. Auditing in a 
        Pluribus system requires the introduction of intermediary objects accompanying 
        each rights transfer in order to keep track of the authorization path. 
      <p> Because an SPKI authorization does not include a direct designation 
        of the resource being authorized, it introduces the possibility of a confused 
        deputy [<a href="ode-references.html#Hardy88">Hardy88</a>]. (A confused 
        deputy uses an authorization given to it by one party to access a resource 
        designated by a different party. In so doing, the confused deputy performs 
        an unintended rights transfer.) If the authorizations are narrow, this 
        problem can be minimized. 
      <p> Authorization in SPKI is expensive. At a minimum each authorization 
        decision requires two signature verification operations by the verifier. 
        The signature on the certificate must be checked, and the signature of 
        the Subject, proving possession of the private key, must also be checked. 
        In addition, the Subject must sign a challenge from the verifier if the 
        system is to remain safe from replay attacks. Compare this cost with Pluribus, 
        where the public key operations are limited to connection establishment. 
        In recognition of this cost, SPKI provides the Certificate Result Certificate 
        which permits an entire certificate chain to be collapsed into one certificate.
