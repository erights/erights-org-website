      <p align="left">First we explain a simplified version of the <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s communications
        protocol, <i>Pluribus</i>, identical from a security point of view, but
        less efficient. The purpose of Pluribus is to provide the Granovetter
        Operator, with all its implied security properties, even when Alice, Bob,
        and Carol are on separate machines. </p>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="distrib-obj"></a>Distributed Objects</h2>
      <p align="left">Objects are aggregated into units called <i>vats</i>. Each
        E object exists in exactly one vat -- we speak of an object being <i>hosted</i>
        by its vat. A vat typically hosts many objects. Similarly, each vat exists
        on one machine at a time, but a machine may host many vats. A good first
        approximation is to think of a vat as a process full of objects -- an
        address space full of objects plus a thread of control. Unlike a typical
        OS process, a vat persists (that is, its state is saved to persistent
        storage when its hosting process is terminated or interrupted), so think
        of a vat-hosting OS process as an incarnation of a vat. The vat maintains
        its identity and state as it passes serially through a sequence of incarnations.
      <p align="center"><img src="images/elems.png" alt="Distributed Shortening Granovetter" width="533"
height="330">
      <p align="left">To enable objects in separate vats to send messages to each
        other, we must bridge from the world of local, intra-address-space language-implementation
        technology to the world of network communications protocols. Our first
        step is conventional: each vat contains a communications system allowing
        it to make connections to, and accept connections from, other vats. Each
        vat's communications system contains objects called <i>proxies</i> (shown
        by half circles in the figure above). When an object in a vat refers to
        an object in a different vat, it actually refers to a proxy object, which
        is the local representative of the remote object. In the illustration,
        when a proxy (b1) is sent a local message (step 1), it encodes the message
        arguments (c1) into a packet which it sends out as a network message (step
        2). When VatB receives the network message, it decodes it into a message
        local to VatB, handshaking with remote vats (VatC) as necessary to create
        the needed proxies (c2, step 3). The decoded message is finally delivered
        to Bob (step 4).
      <p align="left">The description so far applies equally well to many distributed
        object systems, such as CORBA and RMI, that have no ambitions to capability
        security. What more do we need to make this into a secure protocol? (See
        also [<a href="ode-references.html#Donnelley76">Donnelley76</a>, <a href="ode-references.html#Donnelley81">Donnelley81</a>,

      <h2 align="left"><a name="crypto-cap"></a>Cryptographic Capabilities</h2>
      <p align="left">On creation, each vat generates a public/private key pair.
        The fingerprint of the vat's public key is its vat Identity, or VatID.
        What does the VatID identify? The VatID can only be said to designate
        any vat which knows and uses the corresponding private key apparently
        according to the protocol.
      <p align="left">Within a single vat, a capability-arrow is implemented as
        a traditional memory address pointer. Capability security within an address
        space is built out of safe language techniques (made popular by Java,
        but going back to LISP 1.5 and ALGOL 60). A capability-arrow can also
        go between vats. If Alice, Bob, and Carol are in three separate vats,
        then Alice can talk to Carol only because VatA can talk to VatC. An inter-vat
        data connection is secure and authenticated. We care about inductive correctness
        -- assuming a preexisting secure connection between Alice and Bob, and
        another between Alice and Carol, can we establish a similarly secure connection
        between Bob and Carol?
      <p align="left">When VatC first exported, across the vat boundary, a capability
        to access Carol, VatC assigned an unguessable randomly chosen number to
        Carol. We call this a "Swiss number", since it has the knowledge-is-authority
        logic loosely attributed to Swiss bank accounts. When VatA first received
        this capability, VatA thereby came to know Carol's Swiss number and VatC's
        VatID.
      <p align="left">When Alice sends Bob a reference to Carol, VatA tells VatB
        Carol's Swiss number and VatC's VatID. VatB now wishes to obtain the tail
        of a vat-crossing capability-arrow referring directly to Carol, so that
        it may deliver this arrowtail to Bob. VatB first contacts an alleged
        VatC (using location routing/hint information which Pluribus allows to
        be communicated along with the VatID) and asks it for VatC's public key.
        It verifies that this key matches the fingerprint that (it was told) is
        VatC's VatID. The handshake logic then proceeds along the lines of SSL
        (though without certificates, and with perfect forward secrecy): VatC
        proves her knowledge of the corresponding private key, then Diffie-Hellman
        key agreement leads to a shared session key for the duration of the inter-vat
        connection. <i>Only</i> once an authenticated, secure data pipe is set
        up between them does VatB reveal Carol's Swiss number to VatC, enabling
        VatC to associate messages, sent inside VatB to the proxy c2 and then
        encoded over the network to VatC, with Carol.
      <p align="left">A capability is an arrow, and an arrow has two ends. There
        is an impostor problem in both directions. The VatID ensures that the
        vat Bob is speaking to is the one hosting the object Alice meant to introduce
        him to. The Swiss number ensures that the entity allowed to speak to Carol
        is the one Alice chose to enable to do so.
      <h2 align="center"><a name="subj-aggregate"></a>Subjective Aggregation<br>
        --or--<br>
        Only Trust Makes Distinctions</h2>
      <p align="left">Although correct, there's something peculiar in the above
        description. On the one hand, the analysis seems to assume that we aren't
        trusting VatB, which is why Carol's Swiss number isn't revealed to VatB
        until someone reveals it to an object, such as Bob, which is hosted by
        VatB. On the other hand, Alice's intention is to give Bob access to Carol,
        but not to give this access to any other objects, such as Joe, that might
        be hosted by VatB. However, Alice must trust that VatB plays by these
        rules, since Alice, by sending it Carol's Swiss number, has enabled it
        to do otherwise.</p>
      <p align="left">There are two forms of mutual suspicion simultaneously supported
        by this protocol: inter-vat (or inter-machine) mutual suspicion, and inter-object
        mutual suspicion. It would be a mistake for anyone to trust Bob any more
        than they trust VatB. To the objects within a vat, their hosting vat is
        their <i>Trusted Computing Base</i> (TCB). Their own operation is completely
        at the mercy of their TCB, with no escape. Bob's behavior can be seen
        as an aspect of VatB's behavior. </p>
      <p align="left">Only if Alice trusts VatB to behave properly -- that is,
        as if it is actually hosting separate objects interacting with each other
        by capability rules -- does it make sense for Alice to even reason about
        Bob as being in any way separately trusted from Joe. If Alice does not
        trust VatB, then Alice should reason about VatB as a single conspiring
        group of objects pretending to be several separately trustable objects.
        Alice should represent her suspicion by modeling VatB simply as a monolithic
        composite, and all its externally accessible objects (such as Bob and
        Joe) as facets of this composite. Notice that Pluribus grants VatB, considered
        either as a malicious vat or as a monolithic composite, exactly the authority
        it should receive according to capability rules.</p>
      <p align="left">Put another way, mistrust of a vat is equivalent to ignorance
        of the internal relationships among the objects hosted by that vat. A
        malicious vat hosting one set of objects can only cause external effects
        equivalent to a correct vat hosting some different (maliciously coded)
        set of objects. This is the main economy of the distributed capability
        model: we can, without loss of generality, reason as if we are only suspicious
        of objects.</p>
      <p align="left">The capability model, by limiting authority within the transitive
        connectivity of graphs, allows a participant to subjectively aggregate
        arbitrary sets of objects into composites. Given the same graph of objects,
        different participants will employ different aggregations according to
        their own subjective ignorance or suspicions, as we have seen, or merely
        their own lack of interest in making finer distinctions. Capabilities
        are the only security model that simultaneously supports the economy of
        aggregation and the necessary subjectivity in deciding how to aggregate.</p>
      <p align="left">A fully paranoid actor should indeed assume the entire world
        is a monolithic conspiracy against them. Only with some trust that parts
        of the world are independent can we gain evidence of any other hypothesis.</p>
      <h2 align="left"><a name="crypto-payment"></a>Payment in the Crypto Protocol</h2>
      <p>We now revisit the payment example from the Capability Security section,
        describing the behavior of the underlying Pluribus cryptographic protocol.
        Assume that Alice, Bob and the mint are hosted by three separate vats
        (VatA, VatB and VatM) on three separate machines.
      <p>First Alice sprouts a new purse from her main purse, and transfers $10
        into it:
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">def</span><span class="stdin"> </span><span class="defvar">paymentForBob</span><span class="stdin"> := aliceMainPurse.sprout()</span>
<span class="stdout">value: &lt;has 0 Carol bucks></span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This statement causes Alice's vat (VatA) to send a message to the mint's
        vat (VatM). The message includes the Swiss number of <tt>aliceMainPurse</tt>
        and the operation <tt>sprout</tt>. VatM creates a new object as a
        result of the message and sends its Swiss number back to Alice.
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdin">paymentForBob.deposit(10, aliceMainPurse)</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>VatA sends another message to VatM including the Swiss number of the
        newly created <tt>paymentForBob</tt> purse and the <tt>deposit</tt>
        request. The parameters are the immutable number 10 and the Swiss number
        of <tt>aliceMainPurse</tt>. VatM performs the requested operation
        and returns a <tt>null</tt> to indicate that the request succeeded.
      <p>Then Alice sends a <tt>foo</tt> message to Bob, providing the purse
        containing $10 as payment.
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdin">bob.foo(..., paymentForBob, ...)</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>VatA sends a message to Bob's vat (VatB) passing the Swiss number of
        the <tt>bob</tt> object and the operation <tt>foo</tt>. The parameters
        include the Swiss number on VatM of the <tt>paymentForBob</tt> object,
        and the VatID of VatM. This information will allow VatB to make a connection
        to VatM and use the <tt>paymentForBob</tt> object.
      <p>When Bob performs the <tt>deposit</tt> operation:
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="stdin">bobMainPurse.deposit(10, payment)</span></pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>VatB builds the connection to VatM. The connection building process checks
        that VatM has the private key corresponding to the VatM VatID. After the
        connection has been authenticated and secured, VatB sends a <tt>deposit</tt>
        message to the object with the Swiss number of <tt>bobMainPurse</tt>
        passing 10 and the Swiss number of the purse he received from Alice.
      <h2><a name="crypto-reuse"></a>Generic Protocols, Reusable Security</h2>
      <p>Cryptographic protocol design is hard and error prone [<a href="ode-references.html#Schneier96">Schneier96</a>].
        When we can, we should design generic protocols that implement highly
        reusable security abstractions.
      <p>The messages sent between the Alice, Bob, and the mint above are like
        those that might have been part of a simple cryptographic payment protocol.
        However, rather than having to design a specialized cryptographic protocol
        for payment, we have instead reused a generic cryptographic protocol,
        implementing only distributed capabilities, in combination with a simple
        specialized object protocol to yield the same effect.
