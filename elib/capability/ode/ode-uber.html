      <h2 align="left">Emergent Simplicity</h2>
      <p align="left">In many domains of engineering, great leverage comes from 
        channeling the power of a set of building block technologies through an 
        intermediate simplifying abstraction before proceeding to build from there. 
        The most compelling example is the digital logic gate. Below this abstraction 
        is the messy and difficult world of analog circuitry. Above this abstraction 
        is the world of digital devices. We know it would be expensive were we 
        to design each digital device -- shift registers, ALUs, etc -- as a separate 
        ad-hoc exercise in analog design. But <i>why</i> do we benefit by imposing 
        this design constraint on ourselves? I propose the answers lie in <i>constrained 
        causality</i> and <i>signal interoperability</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">In an analog circuit, influences flow in all sorts of directions. 
        A wire is a bidirectional conductor of causality, but it is also an antenna, 
        transmitting and receiving to other wires. A digital circuit is an analog 
        circuit, so this is still true for a digital circuit. However, in a synchronous 
        digital circuit, <i>in-model causality only flows along authorized pathways</i>. 
        The authorized pathways are the uni-directional view of wires, and in-model 
        causality is a 0 or 1 flowing during a clock cycle, ie, an above-threshold 
        voltage arriving on time. Our design rules are supposed to guarantee that 
        all other analog causality can be safely ignored.</p>
      <p align="left">Because our design rules, within a given subsystem, turn 
        voltages into in-model causality in only one way, we know that a 1 emitted 
        from a shift register is also a 1 that can be fed into an ALU. This is 
        <i>signal interoperability</i>. Were each of these components designed 
        separately from analog material, we would always be wrestling with compatibility 
        at the interfaces.</p>
      <p align="left">Remote procedure calls, and then distributed object systems, 
        are likewise economizing abstractions for replacing much of the expensive 
        ad-hoc world of cooperative communications protocols. Rather than expensively 
        hand-design a separate cooperative communications protocol for each reason 
        two processes may have to talk to each other, better to expensively design 
        one cooperative communications protocol for transporting inter-object 
        messages. Then, what would have been separate cooperative communications 
        protocols simply become object interface definitions. Given mutual cooperation, 
        causality flows along messages, and object references received via one 
        &quot;protocol&quot; are immediately reusable within another. We call 
        a generic protocol that subsumes the needs for many particular protocols 
        an <i>uber-protocol</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">The expense of designing communications protocols is nothing 
        compared to the expense of designing cryptographic protocols (***ref DEC 
        SRC, Schneier), so the economy gained from an uber-protocol should be 
        that much greater. Whereas distributed object protocols constrain causality 
        and provide signal interoperability under a mutual cooperation assumption, 
        a cryptographic uber-protocol must provide its guarantees even when under 
        attack. Pluribus provides such a distributed cryptographic capability 
        uber-protocol. Inter-Vat causality flows only via messages, and only along 
        capabilities, and therefore only along authorized pathways. A capability 
        received via a message of one object interface is immediately usable in 
        any other message.</p>
      <p align="left">Why is signal interoperability important? Consider the likely 
        world of cryptographic commerce in the absence of a cryptographic uber-protocol. 
        X works on a cryptographic protocol for running an auction. Y and Z work 
        on two different systems from cryptographic money. W works out a cryptographic 
        escrow exchange agent. Let's say they all do a locally perfect job. Should 
        we expect that the money obtained via Y's protocol will be accepted by 
        X's auction? Or that electronic rights purchased through X's auction will 
        be the kind of rights W's escrow exchange protocol knows how to escrow? 
        An uber-protocol doesn't make this problem trivial, any more than object 
        libraries are trivially reusable! However, in the absence of an uber-protocol, 
        we would have the equivalent of the normal reuse problem on top of the 
        equivalent of the inter-language interoperability problem.</p>
      <h2 align="left">But is this a <i>Cryptographic</i> Uber-Protocol?</h2>
      <p align="left">The design of cryptographic protocols are generally much 
        harder problems than the design of cooperative protocols, as they must 
        work under all sorts of mutual-suspicion constraints. Also, they are a 
        larger design space, because many are built on strange inventions for 
        mapping obscure mathematical properties into very specific mistrust arrangements. 
        Therefore, we are unlikely to find cryptographic uber protocol as comprehensive 
        as the cooperative uber-protocols so far discovered.</p>
      <p>Indeed, although this paper claims a cryptographic implementation of 
        the Granovetter Operator (such as Pluribus) is a cryptographic uber-protocol, 
        there are a number of useful cryptographic protocol design ideas that 
        it does not subsume. Nevertheless, this one protocol subsumes such a large 
        range of stock cryptographic protocols that we should treat it as the 
        80%-solution-framework onto which we should layer other protocols as needed.</p>
