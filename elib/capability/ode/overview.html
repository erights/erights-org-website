      <h1 align="left"><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h1>
      <p align="left"> Every novel cooperative arrangement of mutually suspicious
        parties interacting electronically -- every smart contract -- effectively
        requires a new cryptographic protocol. However, if every new contract
        requires new cryptographic protocol <i>design</i>, our dreams of cryptographically
        enabled electronic commerce would be unreachable. Cryptographic protocol
        design is too hard and expensive, given our unlimited need for new contracts.</p>
      <p align="left">Just as the digital logic gate abstraction allows digital
        circuit designers to create large analog circuits without doing analog
        circuit design, we present cryptographic <i>capabilities</i> as an abstraction
        allowing a similar economy of engineering effort in creating smart contracts.
        We explain the E system, which embodies these principles, and show a covered-call-option
        as a smart contract written in a simple security formalism independent
        of cryptography, but automatically implemented as a cryptographic protocol
        coordinating five mutually suspicious parties.</p>
      <h1 align="left"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
      <p align="left">From simple abstractions, great power may bloom. Sometimes,
        this power comes not from wholly new ideas, but rather from the emergent
        insights that arise when bits of common wisdom from disjoint communities
        come together. For example, Shannon's formalization of the notion of <i>information</i>
        [<a href="ode-references.html#Shannon48">Shannon48</a>] built a bridge
        between the electrical engineer's intuitions about signals, encodings,
        and noise, and the mechanical engineer's intuitions about temperature
        and thermodynamic efficiency.</p>
      <p align="left">This paper takes a first step in unifying the work of the
        object programming community, the capability-based secure operating systems
        community, and the financial cryptography community. Historically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>objects have been strong on abstraction and composition,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>operating systems have been strong on providing a shared platform
            in which disparate processes can interact without being able to damage
            one another, even if they contain malicious code, and </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> financial cryptography has been strong on cooperative protocols
            allowing mutually suspicious parties to trade a diversity of rights
            in the absence of a mutually-trusted platform.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately, each has been weak in the areas where the other two are
        strong. By bridging the intuitions of these communities, we can engineer
        systems with the strengths of all three. The bridge described in this
        paper is based on a joint appreciation, across all three communities,
        of a common abstraction, illustrated by the <i>Granovetter Diagram</i>
        shown on the right. The sociologist Mark Granovetter originally developed
        diagrams of this type to illustrate how the topology of interpersonal
        relationships changes over time, as people introduce people they know
        to each other [<a href="ode-references.html#Granovetter73">Granovetter73</a>].
        Though Granovetter devised this diagram in the context of human relations,
        we have found it to be a powerful notation for understanding the relations
        between computational objects in a network.</p>
      <p><img src="images/granovetter.png" width="339" height="237" align="right" alt="Granovetter Diagram">We
        present this abstraction from six perspectives: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>As the basic step of <i><a href="#perspective-objects">Object Computation</a></i>.</li>
        <li>As the foundation for <i><a href="#perspective-caps">Capability Security</a></i>.</li>
        <li>As a <i><a href="#perspective-crypto">Cryptographic Protocol</a></i>
          implementing distributed capabilities.</li>
        <li>As a <i><a href="#perspective-pki">Public Key Infrastructure</a></i>,
          where certificates act like messages, transmitting authorization among
          the players.</li>
        <li>As the core <i><a href="#perspective-game">Game-Rule</a></i> for secure
          computation modeled as a vast multi-player game. </li>
        <li>As material from which to build a diversity of <i><a href="#perspective-bearer">Financial
          Bearer Instruments</a></i>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We are building the E system [<a href="ode-references.html#E">E</a>]
        to unify these perspectives. E is a simple, secure, distributed, pure-object,
        persistent programming language. E blends the lambda calculus, capability
        security, and modern cryptography. In integrating these diverse features,
        E brings the diverse virtues of the Granovetter Operator to life. Throughout
        the paper we present our examples in E, explaining the language briefly
        as needed.
      <p>Since we can only touch upon each perspective briefly within the space
        allowed for this paper, we have chosen breadth over depth, so that even
        a brief treatment can unify the perspectives. Hopefully our references
        and future writings will provide the needed depth as well.
      <h1 align="left"><a name="perspectives"></a>Six Perspectives</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-objects"></a>Objects</b>. Most importantly,
            the Granovetter Diagram shows the computation step fundamental to
            all object computation: the &quot;message send&quot; (in Smalltalk
            terminology) or the &quot;virtual member function call&quot; (in C++
            terminology). Alice, Bob, and Carol are three objects. In the initial
            conditions, Alice holds a reference to (points at, has access to)
            Bob and Carol. Dynamically, we see that Alice is sending a <tt>foo</tt>
            message to (calling the <tt>foo</tt> member function of) Bob,
            in which a parameter of the message (call) is a copy of Alice's reference
            (pointer, access) to Carol. For conciseness, we will refer to this
            computation step as the <i>Granovetter Operator</i>. </p>
          <p>Object-oriented message passing, along with encapsulation and polymorphism,
            enables modular programming. By designing the interfaces between modules
            on a <i>need-to-know</i> basis, we satisfy the <i>principle of information
            hiding</i> [<a href="ode-references.html#Parnas72">Parnas72</a>] that
            is the basis of much important software engineering theory and practice.</p>
          <p><a href="ode-objects.html">Read more...</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-caps"></a>Capability Security</b>. The Granovetter
            Operator becomes a security primitive given the following constraint:
            If Bob does not already have a reference to Carol, Bob can only come
            to have a reference to Carol if a third party, such as Alice,</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <a name="already-carol"></a>already has a reference to Carol,
              and</li>
            <li><a name="already-bob"></a>already has a reference to Bob, and</li>
            <li> <a name="decides"></a>voluntarily <i>decides</i> to share with
              Bob her reference to Carol.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Adding this property to an object system transforms it into a <i>capability
            system</i>. In a capability system, <i>only connectivity begets connectivity</i>.
            In a capability system, an object's authority to affect the world
            outside itself is determined <i>solely</i> by what references it holds,
            since the only way the object can cause an external effect is to send
            a message via one of these references. Consequently, the mechanics
            of reference-passing determine how authority can change over time.</p>
          <p>The capability model prohibits certain possibilities, such as forgeable
            references or mutable global variables, that the object computation
            model allows (though it does not require them either). Although, in
            principle, the object computation model is perfectly compatible with
            these prohibitions, most embodiments of object computation (typically
            in the form of programming languages) disregard the boundaries imposed
            by the capability model [<a href="ode-references.html#Kahn88">Kahn88</a>].
            We explain why E <i>does</i> stay within these boundaries, and so
            is capability-secure (as are these systems [<a href="ode-references.html#Hewitt73">Hewitt73</a>,
            <a href="ode-references.html#Tribble95">Tribble95</a>, <a href="ode-references.html#Rees96">Rees96</a>]).
            We will present an implementation of capability-based money as an
            example.</p>
          <p>The main capability-system design rule, the <i>principle of least
            authority</i> (sometimes called the &quot;principle of least privilege&quot;
            [<a href="ode-references.html#Saltzer75">Saltzer75</a>]) requires
            one to design interfaces such that authority is handed out only on
            a <i>need-to-do</i> basis [<a href="ode-references.html#Crockford97">Crockford97</a>].</p>
          <p><a href="ode-capabilities.html">Read more...</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-crypto"></a>Cryptographic Protocol</b>. Imagine
            now that Alice, Bob, and Carol are objects residing on three separate
            machines on a computer network. Distributed object systems, such as
            CORBA [<a href="ode-references.html#CORBA">CORBA</a>] and RMI [<a href="ode-references.html#Wollrath99">Wollrath99</a>],
            provide for the diagrammed message send to proceed over the network,
            while preserving the core semantics of the object computation model.
            However, these are <i>cooperative protocols</i>, in that they rely
            on the assumption that the machines involved are correctly cooperating.
            By contrast, a <i>cryptographic protocol</i> implementing the Granovetter
            Operator must also preserve the semantics of the capability model,
            including the prohibitions, in the presence of mutually suspicious
            objects residing on mutually suspicious machines. </p>
          <p>We briefly explain Pluribus, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s cryptographic capability protocol,
            turning E into a securely distributed language. We examine how the
            money example (from the previous section) transparently distributes
            by showing how Pluribus automatically maps the pieces of the example
            to stock cryptographic-protocol elements. </p>
          <p><a href="ode-protocol.html">Read more...</a></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-pki"></a>Public Key Infrastructure</b>. Some
            PKIs, like SPKI (the Simple Public Key Infrastructure [<a href="ode-references.html#Ellison99">Ellison99</a>]),
            interpret digital certificates primarily as statements authorizing
            the players to perform various actions on various resources. In the
            Granovetter Diagram, the message arrow <tt>foo</tt> can be seen
            as such a certificate, signed by Alice, stating that Bob has the authority
            to perform the action represented by Carol. This certificate is meaningful
            if and only if there is a similar certificate granting Alice this
            right, and so on, back to the creator/owner of Carol. Should Bob choose
            to exercise this authority, he would present the certificate-chain
            (or its logical equivalent) as proof that he has received this authorization.</p>
          <p>The enforceable subset of SPKI can be seen as an off-line, auditable,
            heavyweight, non-confinable, semi-capability system, as opposed to
            <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s on-line, repudiatable-by-default, lightweight, confinable, full-capability
            system. Perhaps, by comparing these, we may figure out how to build
            systems with some of the best of both.</p>
          <p><a href="ode-pki.html">Read more...</a></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-game"></a>Game Rules</b>. During a player's
            turn in a board game, the state of the board constrains what moves
            that player may make. From these possible moves, the player chooses
            a particular move, which changes the board and thereby alters the
            moves then available to the other players. Recall the three conditions
            needed for Bob to receive a reference to Carol from Alice. The first
            two conditions are constraints on the possible moves available to
            Alice (and so correspond to <i>mandatory security</i>). The third
            condition is that Alice must choose to make this move (and so corresponds
            to <i>discretionary security</i>). If Alice actually does choose to
            make this move, she thereby changes the moves available to Bob --
            afterwards Bob may both send messages to Carol and send messages to
            yet other parties introducing Carol to them, whereas previously he
            could not.</p>
          <p>Attempts to formalize the semantics of computation, including secure
            computation, have failed to capture the core intuitions of computer
            security practitioners. Fundamental to these intuitions is the notion
            of mutually suspicious, separately interested agents, interacting
            within a framework of rules, under constraints of partial knowledge,
            each in order to pursue their own interests. The formal tools for
            capturing such intuitions are to be found in non-zero-sum, partial-information
            game theory [<a href="ode-references.html#Schelling63">Schelling63</a>].
            The Granovetter Diagram expresses the core game-rule governing secure
            capability-based distributed multi-agent computation, viewed as a
            vast multi-player game.</p>
          <p>We have yet to exploit this perspective in order to apply game theory
            to computation in this manner, but we hope this explanation may point
            the way. We do not explore the game perspective further in this paper.</p>
          <p><a href="ode-game.html">Read more...</a></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="perspective-bearer"></a>Financial Bearer Instruments</b>.
            If Carol provides a useful service, then the ability to send messages
            to Carol may be a useful <i>right</i>. Perhaps Carol answers questions
            from a store of knowledge that she alone is privy to. Perhaps she
            can affect some aspect of the external world, such as pixels on a
            display or the cash dispenser of an automated teller machine. Any
            secure system of <i>electronic rights</i> must solve at least three
            problems: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to represent who currently has what rights.</li>
            <li>How to enable rights holders to exercise those rights they have,
              and no more.</li>
            <li> How to enable rights holders to securely transfer these rights.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The static reference relationships among objects exactly represent
            who currently has what rights. Since a right is exercised by sending
            a message to an object that embodies the right, such as Carol, the
            rule that you can send a message to any object you have a reference
            to, but no others, provides for the exercise of those rights you have,
            and no others. Finally, the transition shown on the Granovetter Diagram
            is both the secure transfer to Bob of the right to pass messages to
            Carol, as well as the exercise, by Alice, of whatever right Bob may
            represent.</p>
          <p>In the face of widespread misuse of the term &quot;electronic commerce&quot;,
            we should remember that &quot;commerce&quot; entails more than just
            the ability of a merchant to accept monetary payment. Commerce is
            a rich set of market interactions that emerge when territory and abilities
            are abstracted into &quot;rights&quot;, and a rich set of arrangements
            that emerge for the mutually acceptable transfer of these rights.
            For large scale electronic commerce, we should concern ourselves with
            those rights which are both representable electronically and enforceable
            electronically, and with mutually-enforceable arrangements for their
            transfer. </p>
          <p>The Granovetter Diagram by itself shows the simplest -- in the electronic
            world -- interesting such electronic right: a non-exclusive, specific,
            exercisable, non-assayable bearer instrument. By contrast, the money
            example from sections 2 and 3 shows an exclusive, fungible, non-exercisable,
            assayable bearer instrument. We sketch a taxonomy of other enforceable
            electronic rights, and show how most of these can be built by simple
            compositions of the Granovetter Operator. Derivative rights, including
            derivative financial instruments, are composed from underlying rights
            via familiar object abstraction. We show a covered call option as
            an example.</p>
