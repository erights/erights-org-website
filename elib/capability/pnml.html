      <p>In the mutually suspicious decentralized electronic world we find ourselves
        in, humans face a dilemma. Computers need to communicate securely with
        other computers, and in so doing, securely designate various objects.
        No problem so far, there are a number of cryptographic means by which
        a bit string (usually no less than 128 bits) can be used globally (ie,
        between mutually suspicious parties, and without translation) as secure
        designators. The clearest example is public key fingerprints, used to
        designate that entity which knows and uses the corresponding private key.
        Let's call such global cryptographic identifiers "keys".
      <blockquote>Note: In <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>, a "key"
        is a cryptographic capability, and is represented by a triple: a public
        key fingerprint, an unguessable secret number (known as a SwissNumber),
        and TCP/IP location hint information used to try to contact the object.
        This last part is not assumed to have any security properties.</blockquote>
      <p> Humans also need to communicate securely with other humans, and in so
        doing, securely designate various objects, including yet other humans.
        Unfortunately, due to their peculiar nature, humans are unable to memorize
        large numbers of keys, and use them as names for a multitude of objects.
        Fortunately, a human-computer symbiote -- a human augmented with a personal
        computer which he trusts (a personal TCB) -- can securely speak to other
        such symbiotes using only keys as designators. In order for the human
        part of such a symbiote to be effective, the computer part must translate
        between the world of keys and the world of human-understandable and memorable
        names. This translation must provide the human with a local world of name-based
        designation whose security properties match the security properties of
        keys.
      <h1><a name="background"></a>Background </h1>
      <p> The progression of attempts to solve this problem has followed a trajectory
        from more centralized to more decentralized solutions.

            space. No coherent theory of what's being authenticated.</p>

            mechanism, humans can only participate in a second class way.</p>

      <p>The last, unfortunately, was never documented for external consumption.
        Though <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/~majordomo/dcms-dev/0036.html">http://www.eros-os.org/~majordomo/dcms-dev/0036.html</a>
        and <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/~majordomo/dcms-dev/0039.html">http://www.eros-os.org/~majordomo/dcms-dev/0039.html</a>
        document Jonathan Shapiro's adaptation of this idea for use in a configuration
        management system.
      <p> In another forum where cryptographic capability ideas were being vigorously
        challenged, a valid concern was raised for which we didn't have a publicly
        documented answer, beyond the above two brief email messages. How can
        we enable humans to deal securely with cryptographic capabilities as human-memorable
        designators? This document answers that question. Since the discussion
        in that forum was already using <a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/echatIndex.html">EChat</a>
        as an example, and since Communities.com originally developed the PetName
        system for a multi-way chat application, I will present the ideas in terms
        of a hypothetical augmented EChat.
      <p> This proposal derives from thinking about the lambda-calculus/capability
        perspective on naming. Program text also uses variable names rather than
        designating particular objects directly. An argument variable name is
        used to send an anonymous object reference to be bound to a parameter
        variable name on reception. It doesn't matter whether the two names are
        the same, since names are only in a local scope. Lambda-based programs
        never communicate names to each other, even though they use only names
        to bring about their communications. This is a pure <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Ecme/usenix.html">key-centric</a>
        approach to communication. The PetName system started as a faithful application
        of the principles that make lambda's magic work. It has grown some from
        there, but this isn't necessarily good.
      <p> Note that this proposal is useful not just for supporting capabilities
        specifically, but more generally whenever human speak in a textual fashion
        to other humans and would like to embed keys in much the way they type
        in, or read, a normal name. Besides EChat, this could all probably be
        applied to PGP email (thereby augmenting it with user-local names).
      <p>See also <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/MathPhys/GRref.html">Norm's
        speculations</a> on the connection between secure designation and General
        Relativity's view of space.
      <h1> <a name="zooko"></a>Zooko's Triangle</h1>
      <p> Zooko's &quot;<a href="http://zooko.com/distnames.html">Names: Decentralized,
        Secure, Human-Memorizable: Choose Two</a>&quot; brings these ideas together
        into a framework we call Zooko's Triangle. Clay Shirky's <a href="http://shirky.com/writings/domain_names.html">Domain
        Names: Memorable, Global, Non-political?</a> and its &quot;pick two&quot;
        conclusion, is an (uncredited) restatement of much of Zooko's paper, with
        some excellent writing, but without a path towards a technical solution.
        Indeed, Shirky claims no non-political solution is possible. We claim
        the PetNames Markup Language proves him wrong.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/zooko-triangle.gif" width="479" height="386" alt="Zooko's Triangle"></p>
      <p>In Zooko's triangle, the three corners are the simultaneous virtues we'd
        like to have in a naming system. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Globally Context-free</b>. We'd like names of global scope, ie,
            in which the correspondence between the name and that which the name
            designates is not context dependent. This allows different parties
            to use the same names to refer to the same entities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Human Meaningful</b>. We'd like names human beings can deal with.
            As Shirky puts it, we'd llike name that pass the side of the bus test,
            &quot;where a user seeing a simple address like IBM.com on a bus or
            a business card (or hearing it over the phone or the radio) could
            go to a browser and type it in.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Securely Collision-free</b>. And finally, we'd like a name system
            that isn't vulnerable to abuse by outside parties, including parties
            labeled &quot;trusted third parties&quot;. For example, the DNS system
            is normally thought to rely on the decisions of ICANN, and as Shirky
            points out, this inevitably turns ICANN into a corruptable political
            entity whether ICANN likes it or not. </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.icannwatch.org/">ICANN Watch</a> especially <a href="http://www.icannwatch.org/article.pl?sid=03/01/16/057208&amp;mode=thread">this
            paper</a>, and the <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000801">Declaration
            of ICANN Independence</a> and the various pages linked to by these
            make the case that ICANN is already long past the corruptable stage,
            and is simply corrupt. Whether true or not, these pages certainly
            establsh that the controversy is inescapably political rather than
            &quot;merely&quot; technical. Even the continuance of ICANN's role
            is the subject of political struggle and dispute, as when the government
            of Tonga <a href="names/icann-not.html">claims</a> that its ownership
            of the &quot;.to&quot; domain is sovereign, and not subject to ICANN's
            whims. While we applaud those on the decentralized side of this political
            struggle, this paper instead seeks a technical solution that avoid
            the need for politics.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As Zooko and Shirky say, we can't have names with all three properties.
        However, we can have names with each of the three pairs of properties,
        and we can build a naming system involving several of these kinds of names,
        in order to make use of all three properties. The PetName system makes
        use of these three kinds of names:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Keys</b>. These are global and secure. As mentioned above, the
            clearest example is a public key fingerprint used to designate that
            entity that knows the corresponding private key. Anyone holding a
            fingerprint can verify that they are speaking to the entity designated
            by this fingerprint. Likewise, the holder of a cryptographic hash
            can verify that a bit string is the data designated by the hash. In
            both cases, the check is independent of the context of the checker
            (hence, global) and not vulnerable to any outside party (secure).
            These are, therefore, <i>self-authenticating designators</i>. <i><font color="#FF0000">(***

            with "nickname", but this had the wrong connotations. My nickname
            is usually understood as a property of me. It's a unary operator:
            <tt>nickname(MarkMiller) =&gt; MarkM</tt>. By contrast, petnames are
            understood to be specific (and private!) to the relationship between
            two people. My Mom's petname for me is, well, I'm not telling. By
            our definition, SPKI is a petname system. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1><a name="pnml"></a>The PetName Markup Language</h1>
      <p> To be fashionable, I will present the proposal in terms of a proposed
        new markup language -- The PetName Markup Language (PNML). Why a markup
        language? I frankly think markup languages are silly ways for software
        to speak to other software. Objects are better, and if the two pieces
        of software are in different address spaces, then serialized object graphs
        are fine. However, humans often speak to other humans in fairly unstructured
        text containing embedded objects or designators. For this, markup languages
        are not too bad, in that they take the literal text to be the "normal"
        case, and require some kind of anti-quote for the non-literal part.
      <p> PNML consists of just two tags: <tt>&lt;pn&gt;<i>pet-name-string</i>&lt;/pn&gt;</tt>
        and <tt>&lt;key&gt;<i>stringified-cryptographic-key</i>&lt;/key&gt;</tt>.
        (In a more speculative section below we'll introduce a third tag: <tt>&lt;s/&gt;</tt>.)
        When used in a context where multiple kinds of cryptographic key need
        to be distinguished but aren't self identifying, we augment the <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt>
        tag with a "<tt>type</tt>" attribute, but postpone standardizing the values
        of this attribute. For E, the stringified key would be exactly <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s
        stringified "<tt>cap://...</tt>" URI.
      <p> <img src="images/zt-step1.gif" width="172" height="134" align="right">The
        goal is that machines should only send to each other text with embedded
        <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt> elements, not <tt>&lt;pn&gt;</tt> elements, since
        those are the form of designation that works robustly between machine.
        Conversely, humans should only need to type or see <tt>&lt;pn&gt;</tt>
        elements containing names meaningful to them. However, we define one markup
        language containing both tags, rather than two markup languages, so humans
        can embed <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt> elements, as they will often wish to do
        using cut-and-paste from other applications (such as PGP).
      <p> Just as each PGP user has his own key-ring, each PNML user-agent has
        a persistent mutable private 1-to-1 mapping from petnames to keys. This
        user-agent knows how to translate text received from its user into text
        transmittable to other user-agents -- replace all <tt>&lt;pn&gt;</tt>
        elements with <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt> elements by looking up the pet-name-strings
        in the local name-space. If a given petname isn't found, the text isn't
        accepted and the user is notified.
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Human types:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;HoneyBunny&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Machine sends:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;key&gt;cap://...&lt;/key&gt;</b><tt>?</tt></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p> <img src="images/zt-step2.gif" width="172" height="134" align="right">More
        interesting is when a user-agent receives text from another user-agent
        and needs to translate it for display to its user. As expected, it replaces
        all <tt>&lt;key&gt;</tt> elements with <tt>&lt;pn&gt;</tt> elements by
        looking up the keys in the local name-space. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Machine receives:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;key&gt;cap://...&lt;/key&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Human reads:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;Ms. Jones&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And if the key isn't found? Let's assume we have some way to come up
        with an initial proposed petname for this key. We'll revisit this issue
        later, but for now it can simply be the string "<tt>unknown</tt>". If
        this name isn't already taken, the user-agent remembers this as the new
        petname for this key. Otherwise, it searches successive names derived
        from this name: "<tt>unknown-1</tt>", "<tt>unknown-2</tt>", etc, until
        it finds one that isn't taken, and remembers that instead. It then uses
        that name in the replacement <tt>&lt;pn&gt;</tt> element. In also places
        this name in a separate persistent, mutable, private <tt>ToBeRenamed</tt>
        table, associated with a copy of the text which introduced this key. This
        table remembers the names not chosen by the user, and therefore ones for
        the user to think about renaming. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Machine receives:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;key&gt;cap://...&lt;/key&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Human reads:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;unknown-3&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Going back to the case where the incoming key is found, if the associated
        petname is in the <tt>ToBeRenamed</tt> table, then a copy of this text
        is added to the text remembered in that table. That table therefore maps
        from names to lists of text.
      <p> Now "<tt>unknown-3</tt>" isn't very informative. However, while there
        are better answers (see below), there are no answers which are more correct.
        Assuming the existing inter-human channels have characterizable security
        properties, and (inductively) assuming that the reader's name space has
        so far maintained a name-key mapping that the reader can use reliably,
        then the only thing the reader knows for sure is what specific others
        have said to this reader about the designated entity. That's why we save
        all incoming text that designates an entity the reader hasn't named yet.
        This text is the information the reader has to work with to choose a reliable
        name.
      <h1> <a name="maint"></a>Maintaining a Name-Space</h1>
      <p> The user-agent exports to its user, through its user-interface, operations
        for examining and editing its data structures. The most important operation,
        of course, is <tt>rename</tt>, which by default also removes that name,
        if present, from the <tt>ToBeRenamed</tt> table.
      <h1> <a name="paths"></a>Naming Paths</h1>
      <p> Starting from here, we should eventually(!) import more of SPKI's power
        by allowing naming paths rather than simple names. We introduce a kind
        of designatable object called a name-space (doesn't have to be 1-to-1,
        can be many-to-1), and a standard way of either invoking it remotely (the
        E way) or of authenticatedly replicating it (the SPKI way). Now
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Human says:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;Bob&lt;s/&gt;Mom&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>can be though of like "Did you get that letter from <b>Bob's Mom</b>?"
        (The apostrophe-s trick for naming paths is taken from Smalltalk-72.)
        Now the sending user-agent can translate in one of two ways. It can look
        up <tt>&lt;pn&gt;Bob&lt;/pn&gt;</tt>'s exported name-space object, and
        ask it what key is associated with "<tt>Mom</tt>". Or it can just translate
        <tt>&lt;pn&gt;Bob&lt;/pn&gt;</tt> and send </p>
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Machine sends:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;key&gt;cap://...&lt;s/&gt;Mom&lt;/key&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p> When the user-agent receives this, it can translate it all the way by
        doing the same lookup:
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Human reads:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;Ms. Jones&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p> or it can present a path:
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Human reads:</td>
            <td>Did you get that letter from <b>&lt;pn&gt;Robert&lt;s/&gt;Mom&lt;/pn&gt;</b>?</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Where do these exported name-space objects come from? Anyone should be
        able to create and maintain a name-space for export, and publicly export
        a read-only facet. In an EChat- or PGP-like scenario, it is probably done
        by deliberately marking a subset of one's pet-name name-space for export.
      <p> Feedback, especially from SPKI folk, would help narrow down these options.
        However, they all correctly preserve the required security properties.

      <p>"<tt>unknown</tt>" really sucks as a base to generate an initial proposed
        petname. This is where the notion of nickname is relevant, although more
        mechanism is needed in order for there to be nicknames. As long as Robert's
        choice of the nickname "<tt>Bob</tt>" can't cause Alice to confuse him
        with someone she has already installed as "<tt>Bob</tt>", then we should
        be willing to start with Robert's proposed name. If there's a conflict,
        Alice will end up seeing "<tt>Bob-3</tt>", and knowing that she didn't
        generate this name because it's in her <tt>ToBeRenamed</tt> table. This
        still tells Alice what Robert suggests she call him, which is useful.
      <p> In E, the user agent might ask the designated object whether it responds
        to "<tt>getNickname</tt>". If it says yes, it could ask it for its nickname.
        Otherwise we could fall back to "<tt>unknown</tt>". The EChat object representing
        a user would, of course, respond to <tt>getNickname</tt>.
      <p> Were we to add all this to PGP, the names encoded in the PGP keys would
        be our nicknames. We could get PGP keys, and therefore nicknames, from
        fingerprints (keys in our sense) by, for example, asking the PGP key servers.
        Each signed key endorsement in PGP can be seen as the equivalent of signed
        text in the <tt>ToBeRenamed</tt> table of the form:
      <blockquote>
        <table cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td><b>&lt;pn&gt;Carl&lt;/pn&gt;</b> says:</td>
            <td>I know <b>&lt;pn&gt;unknown-3&lt;/pn&gt;</b> as Bill Frantz. </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

      <p> Jonathan, I think you should adopt a term other than "true name" for
        the key information. Vernor Vinge's "true name" is the human legible name
        (or other information) than enables others, such as governments, to figure
        out which physical breathing human body you inhabit, and perhaps point
        guns at you. Fortunately, none of the 3 kinds of name we're dealing here
        are necessarily that kind.
      <p> Note: The second email linked to above states that Communities.com is
        currently working on a product version of this system. I want to make
        it clear that I left Communities.com 18 months ago or so, and have no
        idea how these notions evolved in the meantime. Neither party should be
        taken to speak for the other. Also, the ideas I present in this note evolved
        from the PetName system that I knew at Communities.com, but it is not
        a description of that system.
      <p> Norm Hardy's <a href="http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/Personal.html">http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/Personal.html</a>
        is a very different start on exploring the issues of giving capabilities
        a secure user interface. I believe it and this note are complementary.
      <p>Along with the political swamp of ICANN, DNS also brings about our centralized
        vulnerability to the likes of VeriSign and other root CAs. As Zooko has
        elsewhere pointed out, the SSL protocol architects (is this the right
        attribution?), when faced with the Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) problem, &quot;solved&quot;
        it by electing VeriSign to be everyone's shared Man in the Middle -- effectively
        pre-arranging a conspiracy between what would have been the separate MITMs.
