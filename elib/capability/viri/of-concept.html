      <h2>PROOF OF CONCEPT </h2>
      <p> In the military, most new weapons systems go through an evaluation, 
        or proof-of-concept, phase. These are not full-power tests, but baby steps 
        to show that key technology should work as advertised. 
      <p> 
      <p>This sort of testing takes place not only with missiles and bombs but 
        also with the cybernetic implements of information warfare. Indeed, any 
        group that is developing tools to disrupt an adversary's information systems 
        would be downright irresponsible if it did not conduct proof-of-concept 
        demonstrations as part of its R&#38;D process. These tests would not cause 
        great harm: instead, they would be designed to whet the appetite of officials 
        higher up the command chain. </p>
      <p>And what would a proof-of-concept demonstration for an information warfare 
        weapon look like? Possibly a lot like the computer virus attacks the Internet 
        has experienced in recent years. I suspect that some of these electronic 
        attacks were actually the results of deliberate tests for a future attack 
        that could have truly dire consequences. </p>
      <p> 
      <p>To understand my alarm, you need to understand the anatomy of computer 
        viruses and their cousins, worms. Most of these hostile programs have 
        three parts. The first, the "exploit," is the technique the virus or worm 
        uses to break into systems. Most exploits take advantage of a known security 
        flaw--for example, the classic "buffer overflow," in which an excess of 
        incoming data corrupts the information already stored in memory. The second 
        part, the "propagation engine," is the code that targets computers for 
        attack. And the third, the "payload," does the actual damage. </p>
      <p> Viewed through this morphology, the major worms that have disabled computers 
        on the Internet--Code Red, Nimda, Klez, and, most recently, Slammer--share 
        a disturbing similarity. Each one employed a novel--and extremely effective--propagation 
        engine. But for exploits, all these worms have used security vulnerabilities 
        that had been previously identified. And as for the payload: all were 
        duds. Even though each gained so-called administrative privileges to alter 
        the systems they infected, none used its privileges to cause mayhem. 
      <p> Sure, they did some harm. But in nearly every case, the damage was caused 
        by the propagation itself--as if a burglar systematically were to break 
        windows, enter every house on the block, and steal nothing. An actual 
        payload could scramble financial data, erase operating systems, and ruin 
        motherboards by wiping out the contents of their programmable chips. 
      <p> This pattern has been repeated so many times that I believe at least 
        some of these worms are in fact elaborate proof-of-concept tests, created 
        by a clandestine information-warfare lab. This is more plausible than 
        you might first think. Many of the computer viruses written over the past 
        20 years have been the work of a small group of teenagers and young adults 
        engaged in competition with their friends and various antivirus companies. 
        The virus creators quickly learned that any bozo could write a program 
        that could erase other people's hard drives. By the mid-1990s the rogue 
        programmers had elevated the game: scoring points among fellow hackers 
        required clever propagation techniques and tricks for outrunning the antivirus 
        shops. Law enforcement agencies know that hackers from the 1990s are now 
        selling their services to organized crime and terrorists; why not the 
        virus writers? 
      <p> Remember: not a single worm or virus that we have seen in the wild--not 
        one--has employed a novel exploit. That's not surprising. Unknown exploits 
        are far too valuable to reveal in public proof-of-concept testing. Likewise, 
        no worm has deployed a payload that caused significant damage. Why set 
        the death ray to kill, when all you are trying to do is prove that the 
        thing shoots? 
      <table cellpadding="12" width="30%" align="right">
        <tr> 
          <td><b>No computer virus or worm that has been released on the Internet 
            has deployed a truly damaging payload: why set the death ray to kill,

            </b></td>

      <p>Fred Cohen, a computer security researcher who has been studying malicious 
        programs for two decades (and who is credited with coining the term virus), 
        doubts that the worms we have seen are the work of government-run information-warfare 
        labs. But he concedes that smaller labs or solo operators--possibly renegade 
        operations in China or independent outfits looking to sell their services--might 
        have released weakened versions of their worms into the wild as tests. 
        The U.S. military set a sort of precedent in the 1960s when it tested 
        "simulant" germ-warfare agents in the New York City subway and off the 
        coast of San Francisco. And it is widely believed that the original Microsoft 
        Word macro virus, auspiciously named Concept, was written as a proof-of-concept 
        test by a programmer at Microsoft and was inadvertently released on discs 
        at a developers' conference. 
      <p> Speculation about the origin of these worms has taken on more relevance 
        since last summer, when President Bush reportedly signed an order directing 
        the U.S. government to develop guidelines for launching a cyberattack 
        against enemy computer networks. Before that order, my friends in the 
        military were saying that the United States would never consider conducting 
        an offensive information-warfare campaign: as the nation with the most 
        computers, we have the most to lose. But now our government is in the 
        process of legitimizing cybernetic warfare. 
      <p> I'm worried. Today's lame computer worms, even with well-known exploits 
        and dummy payloads, have shut down corporate and government networks. 
        A determined enemy would target a new exploit with a really nasty payload. 
        The proof that time could be a hundred billion dollars in damage.
