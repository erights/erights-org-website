      <h1>General EIO Requirements</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="noblock"></a>Non-blocking.</b> Normal usage of the EIO
            library should not cause a vat to block indefinitely on external I/O,
            or block at all on any non-prompt I/O, even when there are bugs in
            the <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> code using EIO.</p>
          <p>(It would be pointless to require that malicious usage must not cause
            a vat to block, since a malicious entity in a vat can effectively
            block its whole hosting vat anyway with an infinite loop.) </p>
          <p>When wrapping legacy I/O libraries, this requirement relies on those
            libraries stating accurately what operations may proceed promptly.
            For example, an <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/org/erights/e/elib/eio/InStream.html">InStream</a></tt>
            that wraps a Java1.3 <tt>InputStream</tt> or <tt>Reader</tt> will
            only be prompt to the extent that <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/InputStream.html#available()">InputStream.available()</a></tt>
            or <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/Reader.html#ready()">Reader.ready()</a></tt>
            indicates what can be read promptly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="nio"></a>Efficient later.</b> EIO must be implementable
            in Java1.4 using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/nio/">NIO</a>
            without introducing unnecessary threads. </p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="pure"></a>Possible now.</b> EIO must be implementable
            in pure Java1.3 (ie, without <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/nio/">NIO</a>
            or <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Emdw/proj/java-nbio/">NBIO</a>).
            Note that <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> itself requires
            only 1.3 and so must depend on only 1.3. (Though of course, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
            must be compatible with 1.4 and later versions.) Note that this requirement
            cannot be met efficiently now -- on Java 1.3-based implementation
            will require a separate thread to block on each separately blockable
            I/O device on which there's a separate I/O operation posted.</p>
      </ul>
      <h1><a name="streams"></a>InStream and OutStream</h1>
      <p>The center of any I/O library design are the interfaces often known by
        names like InputStream and OutputStream. For EIO, these are <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/org/erights/e/elib/eio/InStream.html">InStream</a></tt>
        and <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/org/erights/e/elib/eio/OutStream.html">OutStream</a></tt>,
        refered to jointly as <i>EIO Streams</i>.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">(XXX I find it difficult to write requirements
        per se. The following list mixes goals with some description of the actual
        design we arrived at in service of those goals.)</font></p>
      <p>As with other I/O libraries, the EIO library both defines the types <tt>InStream</tt>/<tt>OutStream</tt>,
        for itself and others to implement, and provides some built-in implementations
        of these types. When the following list of goals says, for example, that
        &quot;<i>A conforming Foo <a href="../../../glossary.html#MUST" class="glossary">MUST</a>
        ...</i>&quot;, this means, as is conventional, that an implementation
        of Foo <i>must</i> have the stated property in order to be considered
        conforming, though conformance is not detected or enforced, and so should
        not generally be relied upon by clients of a Foo. </p>
      <p>Unless stated otherwise, we do require all built in primitive Stream
        implementations provided by the EIO library to conform, and the built-in
        layered EOI-provided Stream implementations (see <a href="#Composability">Composability</a>
        below) to be <i>conformance preserving</i> -- if the layers they're built
        on conform, then they must conform as well. Likewise, an EIO-provided
        Stream that wraps (is layered upon) a <tt>java.io</tt> stream must be
        conformance preserving -- if the <tt>java.io</tt> stream conforms to its
        contract, then the wrapping EIO Stream must conform as well.</p>
      <p>The goals EIO Streams (<tt>InStream</tt> and <tt>OutStream</tt>) should
        meet are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="wraps"></a>Wraps legacy.</b> EIO Streams must be able
            to wrap the common <tt>java.io</tt> byte and character stream classes,
            such that EIO Streams can be used from <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
            instead of these <tt>java.io</tt> stream classes with well enough
            that the <tt>java.io</tt> stream classes can be removed from the portable
            <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> API spec without loss
            of needed functionality. </p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="tames"></a>Tames legacy.</b> This wrapping must eventually
            be sufficient that we can <a href="../../legacy/index.html">tame</a>
            legacy blocking operations out of existence (from the perspective
            of the <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> programmer), or
            at least make them unnecessary for normal use.</p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="objects"></a>Objects can play too.</b> Besides bytes
            and chars, the API must provide for streams of any type of element,
            in order to bring the power of stream-oriented programming to objects.
            However, when the type is in fact a <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/lang/Class.html#isPrimitive()">scalar
            type</a></tt>, then a packed list-of-scalar representation should
            be used. When used within a vat, a stream of objects must pass references
            to the objects themselves, without serialization. </p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="model"></a>Simple model.</b> The following is the model
            we're using, and serves as an example of the kind of model we require:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>A stream is an ongoing sequence of elements of some type, some
              of which may be known now, and some of which are expected to become
              known in the future. The stream of elements may continue forever,
              it may successfully <i>close</i>, or it may <i>fail</i> with a <i>terminal
              problem</i> (an <tt>IOException</tt> explaining the reason for failure).
              Whether it closes or fails, it is <i>done</i> with a <i>terminator</i>
              indicating how it is done (either <tt>true</tt> or a reference broken
              by the terminal problem). This terminator is conceptually in the
              stream after the last element, but it is not itself an element of
              the stream. </p>
            <p>Elements enter a stream through an <tt>OutStream</tt> and exit
              through an <tt>InStream</tt>. When Alice is writing into a stream
              that Bob reads, we say that Alice is <i>upstream</i> of Bob. Likewise,
              the <tt>OutStream</tt> is upstream of the <tt>InStream</tt>. A client
              of an <tt>OutStream</tt>, such as Alice, is a <i>producer</i>. A
              client of an <tt>InStream</tt>, such as Bob, is a <i>consumer</i>.</p>
          </blockquote>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="familiar"></a>Synchronous use is instantly familiar.</b>
            The synchronous reading operations must be easily understandable to
            someone familiar with <tt>java.io</tt>'s <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/InputStream.html">InputStream</a></tt>
            or <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/Reader.html">Reader</a></tt>.
            Likewise with the synchronous writing operations and java.io's <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/OutputStream.html">OutputStream</a></tt>
            and <tt><a href="../../../javadoc/java/io/Writer.html">Writer</a></tt>.</p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="learned"></a>Asynchronous use is easily learned.</b>
            The asynchronous operations must be easily understandable to someone
            who's learned the synchronous operations and is already familiar with
            the basic <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> concurrency
            model.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="simple"></a>Simple things <i>must</i> be simple, complex
            things <i>should</i> be possible.</b> We are explicitly willing to
            accept APIs unable to do some complex things, to be examined on a
            case-by-case basis.</p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="failstop"></a>Fail-stop.</b> The streams that <tt>OutStream</tt>
            writes and <tt>InStream</tt> reads should be fail-stop. The built-in
            streams provided by EIO must be fail-stop. This means they must reliably
            deliver the elements of the stream in order until they close or fail.
            Failure must be distinguishable from normal termination. As on normal
            termination, on failure the stream must stop -- termination must be
            a permanent condition. Once a stream is done, it should release its
            buffers.</p>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="Composability"></a>Composability:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="pipes"></a>Pipes.</b> EIO must provide a pipe abstraction
                that has an <tt>InStream</tt> facet and an <tt>OutStream</tt>
                facet. Everything written to the <tt>OutStream</tt> facet must
                be immediately available to from the <tt>InStream</tt> facet.</p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="filters"></a>Filters.</b> Streams must be easily
                composable: As with Unix shell programming, it must be easy to
                create <i>filters</i> -- intermediaries that read from an InStream
                and write to an OutStream. Placing filters between pipes effectively
                makes longer pipes or transducting pipes. Such a filter may or
                may not require the InStream and OutStream to be in the same vat
                as itself. The EIO library itself must provide a some basic filters,
                including an inter-vat copying filter, which can therefore be
                used for making inter-vat pipes.</p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="isolators"></a>Pipes as &quot;opto-isolators&quot;.</b>
                As is generally true of capability style, InStreams and OutStreams
                should have no <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-report/html/index.html#unchecked">unchecked
                preconditions</a>. The InStreams and OutStreams provided by EIO
                must nave no unchecked preconditions. Therefore, when Alice writes
                to the OutStream W of a pipe and Bob reads from the InStream R
                of the pipe (<tt>Alice-&gt;W=R-&gt;Bob</tt>), then Alice must
                see good W behavior even if Bob misbehaves, and Bob must see good
                R behavior even if Alice misbehaves. </p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="failprop"></a>Failure propogation.</b> Pipes and
                filters, including the built-in ones, may spontaneously fail unless
                their specific contract says otherwise. They may also be told
                to fail by their clients (through the InStream and OutStream interfaces).
                The built in pipes and filters must report their failure both
                upstream and downstream. A built-in pipe or filter that isn't
                already done and receives a failure report must itself fail with
                the same terminal problem, whose report it must therefore propogate.
                Other pipes and filters should do likewise.</p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="closeprop"></a>Close propogation.</b> The built-in
                pipes and filters must not spontaneously <i>close</i> (terminate
                successfully) -- A <i>close</i> indicates an intentional decision
                by some client of the EIO library. When Alice closes her OutStream,
                she is informing Bob that she has finished writing elements to
                the stream. When Bob closes his InStream, he is informing Alice
                that he's no longer interested in anything she has to say.</p>
              <p> If Carol closes an InStream or OutStream that's in the chain
                between Alice and Bob (or likewise, if she tells it to fail),
                then she's revoking Alice's ability to talk to Bob through that
                channel. The built-in pipes and filters must therefore propogate
                closes both upstream and downstream. (For this use, we currently
                recommend that Carol tell the stream to fail rather then close.
                She can then use the terminal problem to inform both Alice and
                Bob why she's revoked their ability to communicate.)</p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="backpressure"></a>Backpressure, or flow control.</b>
                There must be a basic set of built-in pipes and filters that only
                require bounded buffers. As these buffers fill up, these must
                propogate backpressure upstream, which is to say, avoid draining
                elements from the upstream pipes and filters. Therefore, the InStream
                and OutStream APIs must make it possible to deal with bounded
                buffers and to propogate backpressure. Backpressure must be able
                to propogate to the EIO client code at the end point who can use
                it to postpone further production.</p>
            <li>
              <p><s><b><font color="#FF0000"><a name="retransmit"></a>Error control</font></b></s><b>,
                not.</b> Although comm protocols typically bundle flow control
                and error control together, error control (retransmission) is
                explicitly not a requirement, since any such errors can be masked
                at a lower level, and our fail-stop requirement requires them
                to be masked. By contrast, flow control cannot be masked, but
                must instead be made visible to application code.</p>
            <li>
              <p><b><a name="flush"></a>Flush pressure.</b> With an OutStream,
                it must be possible to obligate a stream to eventually deliver
                all elements that have already entered the stream. The built-in
                pipes and filters must honor this obligation up to the limits
                set by termination and backpressure. </p>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><a name="immediacy"></a>Preserve immediacy.</b> The built-in legacy
            wrappers must provide all the immediate reading or writing power of
            the underlying stream abstractions: If 37 bytes are available on the
            underlying stream, then it must be possible to read 37 bytes <i>now</i>
            from an InStream that wraps that stream. When composed through pipes
            and filters, this immediacy may be subject to the limitations imposed
            by these intermediaries. In particular, all immediacy guarantees are
            lost over an inter-vat pipe.</p>
