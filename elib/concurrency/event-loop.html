      <p ALIGN="left">It seems that all capability systems, including E, could
        have been derived by the following recipe: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Start with the Lambda Calculus. This gives us all the properties
            mentioned <a href="../capability/ode/ode-capabilities.html#patt-coop">here</a>
            that define a capability system, except that Bob has no way to retain
            a dynamically acquired reference to Carol. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Optional: Add a message dispatch mechanism. Pure lambda calculus
            is great at defining one-method objects, but your users want to create
            objects that respond to several different types of request. E provides
            for this directly in the kernel, but Actors, Scheme, KeyKOS, and EROS
            show that it need not be primitive. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add object-local mutable memory and side-effects. Bob can now retain
            his ability to access Carol. There are lots of ways to do this: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Smalltalk and Java provide mutable instance variable declarations.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Scheme and E provide for mutable memory by lexically binding
                names, not to values, but to mutable <i>slots</i> (or <i>locations</i>
                in Scheme) holding values. Slots are a mutable object type primitively
                provided by both kernels -- if they weren't provided they could
                not be written in the language. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> KeyKOS, EROS, and other capability operating systems provide
                pages of mutable memory as a primitive data type. By squinting
                hard enough, you can see their similarity to Scheme and <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Actors, Flat Concurrent Prolog, Vulcan, and Joule all define
                an object as a tail-recursive nano-process, fetching one message
                at a time from a per-object message queue (i.e., the Actor mailbox).
                In response to a message, a method specifies what object is to
                receive the next message from the same mailbox. Typically this
                is an object just like itself except for different values for
                some instance variables. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p> <i>(For more on steps 1, 2, and 3, see <a href="../capability/ode/ode-objects.html">this</a>.)</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Much of the charm of pure Lambda Calculus is its blissful ignorance
            of all issues of time and execution order. Arithmetic is beautifully
            timeless in the same sense. Unfortunately, once we add side-effects,
            we have to come to terms with these issues. Solutions that enable
            us, not only to avoid confusing ourselves with our own side-effects,
            but to create computation that can interact with an ongoing concurrent
            world, are termed concurrency-control. [See also <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/3757/0">On
            the development of reactive systems</a> by Harel and Pnueli for a
            similar distinction between <i>transformational</i> and <i>reactive</i>
            systems.] </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <P ALIGN="left">The first two problems a concurrency control paradigm must
        solve are safety -- precautions against confusing ourselves, and liveness
        -- knowing we can still make progress despite these precautions.
      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="safety"></a>Safety: Preserving Consistency</h1>
      <P ALIGN="left">Even with sequential programs, once we have side-effects,
        we have many more opportunities to confuse ourselves, and this can get
        much worse with concurrency. Friedrich Hayek's writings on economics enable
        us to see the commonality between the problems of concurrency control,
        pre-object programming, and command economies. All three suffer from plan
        interference.
      <P ALIGN="left">Before objects, one part of a program might manipulate shared
        data in a way that destroys assumptions made by another part of the program
        -- the left hand not knowing about the right hand and all that. Before
        objects, there was no reasonable way to keep all these distributed assumptions
        straight. I remember this happening to me repeatedly while coding the
        left hand, even if I'd just coded the right hand myself a few days ago.
        Of course, it only got worse with more people and more time to forget.
      <P ALIGN="left">Hayek's explanation of the primary virtue of property rights
        for organizing large scale economic activity parallels the rationale for
        encapsulation in object-oriented systems: to provide a domain (an object's
        encapsulation boundary) in which an agent (the object) can execute plans
        (the object's methods) that use resources (an object's private state),
        where the proper functioning of these plans depends on these resources
        not being used simultaneously by conflicting plans. By dividing up the
        resources of society (the state of a computational system) into separately
        owned chunks (private object states), we enable a massive number of plans
        to make use of a massive number of resources without needing to resolve
        a massive number of conflicting assumptions.
      <P ALIGN="left">Concurrency introduces a new kind of plan-interference:
        plan interleaving. Pre-object sequential programs got into trouble just
        from changes to assumptions between one procedure call and the next. While
        a procedure call is in progress, the delicacy of assumptions in the air
        is often much greater. Concurrency means other procedures executing simultaneously
        can interfere with these delicate assumptions. A simple example in Java:
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="defobj">CounterExample</span> {
    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="defvar">myCounter</span> = 0;

    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="defverb">incr</span>() {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> myCounter++;
    }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <P ALIGN="left">The code compiled from <tt>myCounter++</tt> makes micro-assumptions.
        It reads the value of <tt>myCounter</tt> into a register, increments the
        register, and writes the new value back out. If two threads call <tt>incr()</tt>
        simultaneously, one may overwrite the effect of the other, breaking the
        counter.
      <P ALIGN="left">A plan with a stale assumption may proceed to cause damage
        because its proper functioning depends on facts which are no longer true.
        Classically, the consistency problem is phrased in terms of preserving
        object invariants, but it is better to focus on avoiding stale assumptions.
        Since the plan assumptions most likely to be broken by plan interleaving
        are in stack-frames, a useful concurrency control slogan is <i>avoid stale
        stack-frames</i>.
      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="liveness"></a>Liveness: Avoiding Deadlock </h1>
      <P ALIGN="left">The thread paradigm attempts to avoid stale assumptions
        by introducing <i>locking</i>. While one part of the program holds delicate
        assumptions about another part of the program, it also holds a lock on
        that other part of the program to keep it from changing out from underneath
        it. For example, the above Java code would be <i>thread safe</i> as follows:
      <blockquote>
        <pre><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="defobj">CounterExample</span> {
    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="defvar">myCounter</span> = 0;

    <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="keyword"><u>synchronized</u></span> <span class="defverb">incr</span>() {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> myCounter++;
    }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <P ALIGN="left">The <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword means the <tt>incr()</tt>
        method must obtain a lock on the counter object as a whole before proceeding
        into the method body, and that it should release this lock on exit. For
        this counter, the above code is unproblematic. However, in general the
        method body will call other methods on other objects. This means the thread
        will be holding some locks (on objects whose synchronized methods are
        part-way through execution) while waiting to obtain other locks. This
        is a formula for deadly embrace. To write correct thread-based programs,
        one must avoid the possibility of a cyclic locking dependency.
      <P ALIGN="left">Given the other goals of object oriented programming --
        encapsulation, abstraction, composition, and polymorphism -- the interface
        contract of an abstraction must state everything about its locking behavior
        needed to use it correctly. This is simply too hard, and very few are
        able to succeed at it.
      <P ALIGN="center"><img src="images/badtradeoff.gif" alt="Escaping the Tradeoff">
      <P ALIGN="left">A correct program must both preserve consistency and be
        free of deadlocks. In the thread paradigm, for a complex program composed
        from separately written modules, if there are enough locks (synchronized
        methods or whatever) sprinkled around to have a high confidence in the
        program's safety, there should usually be low confidence in the program's
        liveness (the upper left corner). If locks are only inserted where their
        deadlock dangers have been carefully examined, a program that one can
        afford to write will have too few locks to be confident in its safety.
        By contrast, you can easily write event-loop programs in which you have
        high confidence in its safety and its liveness.
      <h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="deadness"></a>Other Liveness Issues</h2>
      <p ALIGN="left">Besides deadlock, there are other kinds of bugs which can
        prevent a program from making progress. While E doesn't have classic deadlock,
        it still has these vulnerabilities, some of which resemble deadlock.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">Livelock -- infinite loops steal the vat's thread</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">An infinite loop prevents this incarnation of a vat from
        ever again making progress, just as it would prevent a conventional thread
        from making progress. As with conventional threads, it does not prevent
        other vats (threads) from making progress. Unfortunately, since each E
        object is in only one vat, livelocking a vat does lock up all objects
        within a vat. (This would be analogous to livelocking a thread that holds
        a <tt>synchronized</tt> lock on several objects.)</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Fortunately, for a persistent vat, this locks up only the
        vat incarnation, not the vat itself. By killing the livelocked incarnation,
        the vat can roll back to its last checkpoint, be reincarnated, and proceed
        from there. Unfortunately, this doesn't guarantee that it won't livelock
        again. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Turing's halting problem demonstrates the ultimate unsolvability
        of this problem.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left"><a href="../../elang/concurrency/epimenides.html">Datalock</a>
        -- recursive data definition with no bottom</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">This also includes when-catches that are &quot;waiting&quot;
        (posted as callbacks for) promises that the other would resolve.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">Gridlock -- messages need space to move</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">Technically, this looks like a classic deadlock, but it's
        caused specifically by lack of outgoing buffers. The distinction between
        deadlock and gridlock? If more buffer space would have caused you not
        to have locked up <i>yet</i>, then it's gridlock rather than deadlock.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">Lost Signal -- overslept, forgot to set the alarm</h3>
      <p>An <a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-August/005629.html">example</a>,
        due to Mark Seaborn (thanks!): If you have a when-catch &quot;waiting&quot;
        (posted as a callback) for a promise to be resolved, but in the code that's
        supposed to resolve it, you forget to call &quot;<tt>resolve</tt>&quot;
        in all applicable cases. Of course, actual lost signal bugs may be arbitrarily
        more complicated than this.</p>

            The referenced tutorial is aimed at typical working programmers; I
            think language hackers would get more out of the main erights.org
            site. This particular issue is discussed at <a href="http://erights.org/elib/concurrency/event-loop.html">http://erights.org/elib/concurrency/event-loop.html</a>
            and pages linked from there.
            <p> I think the claim of eliminating deadlock bugs is like the claim
              functional languages make to eliminate side-effect bugs. You can
              still write code such that the same kind of interference occurs
              (in both cases), but the language leads you naturally away from
              it. If this analogy is right, using event-loop concurrency instead
              of threads should be a good idea a lot of the time even in languages
              that don't support it, just like avoiding side effects can improve
              your C code. Zooko wrote about his Mojo Nation experiences along
              those lines: "<a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-July/005410.html">[E-Lang]
              Deadlock-free</a>" Jonathan Rees seems to be the first to make this
              analogy: "<a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-August/005585.html">[E-Lang]
              analogy between "when" and monads</a>"
            <p> I've never written any concurrent code in E, so my own opinion
              isn't worth much. Mark Miller gave a list of other relevant posts:
