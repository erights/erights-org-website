          (*)</li>
        <li>The synchronous <b><a href="#outcome">outcome</a></b>, which has three

              <tt>continue()</tt></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The asynchronous <i>eventual</i> (&quot;<tt>&lt;-</tt>&quot;) <b><a href="#send">send</a></b>,
          where an outcome report
          <ol>
            <li> is not expected -- the <b><a href="#sendOnly">sendOnly</a></b>.</li>
            <li> may be expected -- the <a href="#pipe-send"><b>pipelined-send</b></a>
              (*)</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>For all of these, a message is conveyed to an individual recipient, and
        contains at least a verb (a String) and a list of arguments. A message
        often represents a request (identified by the verb and the number of arguments,
        but not their types), so the recipient generally knows why it is receiving
        new authority. This facilitates the programming of non-confusable <a href="../capability/deputy.html">deputies</a>.
        For the cases marked with (*), the message additionally contains an implicit
        <i>continuation</i> -- the object to which the outcome of performing the
        request should be reported.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/call.gif" width="238" height="287" align="right" alt="Immediate Call Diagram"><i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
        computation only occurs within a <i>stack-frame</i> -- shown as a lightning
        bolt within an object. A stack-frame happens when an object receives an
        <i>immediate call</i> or <i>eventual send</i> (sendOnly or pipelined-send).
      <p align="left">Recall that an object is an instance of a behavior-description
        (an object-expression in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>,
        or a <i>class</i> in most other object languages). An instance combines
        a behavior description with the state from its instantiating context (in
        <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>, the scope in which the object
        expression was evaluated). Similarly, a stack-frame can be seen as an
        instance of the method or matcher corresponding to the received message,
        and combines the described behavior with state as well. The stack-frame's
        state is the object's state plus the state resulting from matching the
        incoming message with the head of the method or matcher. During its execution,
        a stack-frame can accumulate more state by defining new variables.
      <p align="left">Since all computation happens only within stack-frames,
        all messages are emitted only from stack-frames. When object-granularity
        analysis suffices, as it often does for security reasoning, we often skip
        illustrating the stack-frames, as in the <a href="../capability/ode/index.html">Granovetter
        Diagram</a>.
      <h2 align="left"><a name="call"></a>i) The Immediate Call</h2>
      <p align="left">The above diagram and the following code illustrates Alice
        synchronously calling Bob:
      <p align="left">
      <blockquote>
        <pre>def alice {
    to doSomething() {
        def result := bob.foo(carol)
        ... <font class="comment"># stuff after call</font>
    }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">The call is only allowed if the reference to the recipient
        is <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>. Otherwise, the attempt to
        call instead throws an appropriate exception.
      <p align="left"><img src="images/stackchain.gif" width="288" height="353" align="right" alt="Call-Chain Diagram">Besides
        the components shared by all messages, a synchronous call contains an
        additional special argument -- the <i>continuation</i> -- that points
        at the caller's stack-frame. The call also turns the calling stack-frame
        from active to suspended. Computation in fact occurs only in active stack-frames.
        A suspended stack-frame must be pointed to by exactly one special continuation
        argument. An active stack-frame is not pointed at. There can be at most
        one active stack-frame in a Vat, and all stack-frames are in a linear
        chain between it and a <i>top stack-frame</i> -- a stack-frame directly
        spawned to service an eventual send. (When between turns, there are no
        stack-frames, as happens when the queue is empty, or when a Vat is sitting
        on disk waiting to be revived from checkpoint.)
      <p align="left">The message passed in a call need not be allocated as a
        separate object, as no time passes between departing from the caller and
        arriving at the callee. Rather, the act of calling simultaneously creates
        the receiving stack-frame in the callee. All stack-frames contain the
        special continuation argument from the message they received, but -- unlike
        the other arguments received from the message -- the continuation is not
        explicitly accessible to the program. (Like the denotational semantics,
        and unlike Actors or Scheme, continuations are reified only in our model
        of <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>, but not to a callee written
        in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. They are only for expository
        purposes.)
      <p align="left">See also the <a href="../../elang/kernel/CallExpr.html">Kernel-E
        Call Expression</a>.
      <h2 align="left"><a name="outcome"></a>ii) Synchronous Outcome of Stack-Frame
        Completion</h2>
      <p align="left">The callee can use the continuation only by completing the
        execution of its stack-frame, thereby also causing it to be discarded.
        The nature of this completion implicitly passes an outcome message to
        the continuation. Unlike calls and pipelined-sends, an outcome message
        has no hidden continuation argument. There are three kinds of outcome,
        each represented with its own outcome message. When the continuation is
        a stack-frame, ie, when the invoker is an immediate-caller, these outcome
        messages are also only for expository purposes, as neither the caller
        nor callee can deal with them explicitly. We choose to describe these
        as messages so we can understand all transfer of authority and control
        in terms of the <a href="../capability/ode/index.html">Granovetter diagram</a>.
      <p align="left">
      <ol>
        <li><a name="success"></a><img src="images/completion.gif" width="199" height="287" align="right" alt="Call-Completion Diagram"><b>Success</b>,
          corresponding to "falling off the end" and represented by passing a
          "<tt>resolve(result)</tt>" message to the continuation. The diagram
          and the following code illustrate Bob returning Dana as a successful
          result to Alice:
          <p align="left">
          <blockquote>
            <pre>def bob {
    to foo(carol) {
        ... <font class="comment"># whatever
</font>        dana
    }
}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In this case, the call expression with which Alice called Bob evaluates
            to this result, and the stack-frame in Alice suspended on this call
            expression continues from this point, binding Alice's &quot;<tt>result</tt>&quot;
            variable to Dana.</p>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b><a name="failure"></a>Failure</b>, as a result of
            execution of a "<tt>throw(problem)</tt>" and represented by passing
            a "<tt>smash(problem)</tt>" message to the continuation. The following
            code:
          <p align="left">
          <blockquote>
            <pre>def bob {
    to foo(carol) {
        ... <font class="comment"># whatever</font>
        throw(dana)
        ... <font class="comment"># whatever
</font>    }
}</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">can be illustrated with the same diagram, but the verb
            is now "<tt>smash</tt>" instead of "<tt>resolve</tt>". Execution within
            Alice's stack-frame now skips to the closest enclosing <a href="../../elang/kernel/CatchExpr.html">try-catch</a>
            or <a href="../../elang/kernel/FinallyExpr.html">try-finally</a> expression.
            If these are none, then Alice's stack-frame completes in failure as
            well, and the <tt>smash(problem)</tt> message gets forwarded to Alice's
            stack-frame's continuation.
          <p>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><b><a name="escape"></a>Escape</b>. Invoking an enabled
            <i>ejector</i> causes the current continuation to be called with an
            "<tt>eject(ejector, value)</tt>" message. An ejector is created in
            an <i>enabled</i> state at the beginning of an <a href="../../elang/kernel/EscapeExpr.html"><tt>escape</tt>
            expression</a>, and <i>disabled</i> on exit from its creating escape
            expression. (This limited lifetime means it has only <i>dynamic extent</i>.)
            Each escape expression creates a stack-frame continuation which recognizes
            its own ejector. Except for this self-recognition, an eject/2 message
            just causes unwinding as it's forwarded along.</p>
          <p>Since only an enabled ejector can cause an <tt>eject/2</tt> message
            to be passed to the continuation, such a message will only be sent
            to a stack-frame continuation whose creating escape expression is
            still live on that stack.</p>
          </li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left">Both Failure and Escape are forms of <i>non-local exit</i>.
      <p align="left">Other than by invoking its continuation, the callee cannot
        stop executing, even on I/O. I/O operations that would normally block
        are instead handled by requesting notification be delivered -- by sending
        -- to a designated object. As a result, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
        is strongly deadlock-free (but is still subject to live-lock by infinite
        loops).
      <h2 align="left"><a name="send"></a>iii) The Eventual Send</h2>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/sendOnly.gif" width="238" height="287" align="right" alt="SendOnly Diagram">There
        are two forms of eventual send, written the same way, but distinguished
        by whether the value of send expression appears to be needed.
      <p align="left">
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><a name="sendOnly"></a><b>sendOnly</b>. When a send expression appears
            in a context where it is statically apparent that the value of the
            send expression will be unused, such as to the left of a semi-colon:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>bob &lt;- foo(carol); ...</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p>then the message is a pure one-way message containing only the verb
            (&quot;foo&quot;) and a list of the explicit arguments ([carol]),
            just as shown in the basic Granovetter diagram. The only feedback
            Alice can get from the performance of the message is that which she
            explicitly arranges for. When Bob finishes processing the message,
            he reports the outcome of the turn to no one.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><a name="pipe-send"></a></i><b>The pipelined send</b>. When a
            send expression appears in a context where static analysis does not
            rule out that the value may be used, such as on the right side of
            a <tt>def</tt>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>def promise := bob &lt;- foo(carol); </pre>
          </blockquote>
          <p><i><img src="images/send.gif" width="238" height="287" align="right" alt="Pipelined Send Diagram"></i>then,
            like the immediate call, the message additionally contains a continuation.
            As with the call, when Bob finishes processing the message, the outcome
            is reported to the continuation. Unlike a call, the continuation is
            not a stack-frame but the <a href="../../javadoc/org/erights/e/elib/ref/Resolver.html">Resolver</a>
            of a promise. This is the arrowhead with the gray halo shown in continuation-position
            in the message. Since the outcome to be reported is the outcome of
            an eventual send, it is the outcome of a <i>top-level</i> stack-frame,
            which is to say, the outcome of a turn as a whole.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Turning Control-Flow into Semi-Data-Flow</h2>
      <p>Since Ejectors are only dynamic in extent -- they only remain valid until
        their spawning escape expression completes -- the outcome of a turn cannot
        be an escape, only success or failure. Therefore, the Resolver only needs
        to respond to &quot;<tt>resolve(result)</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>smash(problem)</tt>&quot;.
        In the first case, the promise becomes equivalent to <tt>result</tt>.
        In the second, the promise becomes broken, and problem is reported as
        the reason. </p>
      <p>Assume that <tt>brokenRef</tt> is a reference broken with <tt>problem</tt>.
        Note that a stack-frame as continuation reacts differently to &quot;<tt>resolve(brokenRef)</tt>&quot;
        and &quot;<tt>smash(problem)</tt>&quot; -- the first causes successful
        evaluation to <tt>brokenRef</tt> while the second causes exceptional flow
        of control. On the other hand, A Resolver reacts to these two messages
        identically. As a result, Alice cannot distinguish between these two ways
        Bob may have reported a problematic outcome.</p>
      <p align="left">All messages sent on a reference arrow move towards the
        arrowhead in order to eventually be delivered to the object the reference
        designates. Messages sent on an unresolved promise do likewise, but wait
        behind the unbound arrowhead until the promise is resolved. Once the promise
        is resolved, all messages sent on the promise may now be delivered to
        this resolution. In the control-flow programming we started with the caller
        waits for the recipient to be determined. By contrast, with <i>semi-data-flow</i>
        programming -- the message, not the sender, waits for the recipient to
        be determined. </p>
      <p align="left">(We call this <i>semi-data-flow</i> to distinguish it from
        conventional data flow. In conventional data flow, a message would not
        be delivered until the recipient and all its arguments were resolved.
        This cannot be reconciled with <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s
        <a href="partial-order.html">partial ordering constraints</a>, and is
        undesirable on other grounds as well. On those occasions where it is desired,
        it may easily be programmed in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>.
        See the <tt>promiseAllDone</tt> <font color="#FF0000">(*** link needed)</font>
        pattern.)</p>
      <h2 align="left">Turning Semi-Data-Flow back into Control-Flow</h2>
      <p align="left">In our story so far, there is a puzzling contagion of eventual-ness.
        Once you have a reference that might be eventual, you must send rather
        than call on it; and when you do so, you get back another eventual reference
        as a promise for the result. The <a href="when/index.html">Layers of When</a>
        explains how we can arrange for immediate control flow <i>when</i> a reference
        becomes fulfilled or broken.</p>
