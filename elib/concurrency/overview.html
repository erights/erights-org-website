      <hr> <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" -->
      <p>To programmers schooled in the C/Java/Python/Scheme traditions, the most
        unfamiliar part of E is its handling of concurrency. The conventional
        concurrency style -- multiple preemptive threads operating on shared data
        -- has been an unmitigated disaster. Although many people have learned
        this paradigm, very few have learned -- or could learn -- how to write
        complex <i>correct</i> programs in this paradigm. A correct program must
        maintain consistency while avoiding deadlock. Further, when extended to
        distributed systems, threads usually lead one into horribly inefficient
        communications patterns and consistency-recovery mechanisms (synchronous
        RPC and distributed transactions, respectively).</p>
      <p>However, threads are a largely <i>unexamined</i> disaster, as few realize
        that any alternative is possible. Ironically, many people (especially
        UI programmers) already have lots of experience with a better alternative
        -- event loop programming -- without realizing it. We suffer from a blind
        spot. Although experience with event loops has generally been pleasant,
        and although the same effort on quality makes an event loop program much
        more reliable than a similar thread-based program, the common prejudice
        is to view event-loop programming as <i>less respectable</i> than thread-based
        programming. Event-loops are seen as disrespectable hacks we use only
        until we can build the proper solution --threads. <i>Real</i> computer
        scientists use threads.</p>
      <p>Classic event-loops may feel dirty and hard to program in, but that's
        because, with this lack of respect, they have not received a fraction
        of the investment in tools and abstraction design that has been thrown
        at threads. At the same time, a different school of programming -- represented
        by <a href="../../history/actors.html">Actors</a>, <a href="../../history/fcp.html">Concurrent
        Logic Programming</a>, <a href="http://jerry.c-lab.de/%7Ewolfgang/PJ/">Concurrent
        Constraint Programming</a>, and <a href="../../history/joule/index.html">Joule</a>
        -- have done all their control flow with nothing but communicating event
        loops. These languages have shown how to provide high quality linguistic
        support for event-loop programming. Event loops are so successful at taming
        concurrency that these languages succeed at being <i>massively concurrent</i>
        while still being stateful. However, they are only concurrent -- they
        do not contain a sequential programming subsystem -- and so they are inaccessible
        to most programmers.</p>
      <p>E reconciles these tensions. E supports event-loop programming with linguistic
        abstractions derived from these massively concurrent languages. At the
        same time, E combines event-loops and sequential programming in essentially
        the way familiar to UI programmers. The E programmer can easily, reliably,
        and efficiently maintain consistency without deadlock in the face of both
        concurrency and distribution. </p>
