        Full Order</h1>
      <p>Among messages successively <i>sent</i> on a single reference (ie, using 
        the <i>eventual send</i> operator &quot;<tt>&lt;-</tt>&quot;), E guarantees 
        fully order-preserving delivery. All messages are delivered in the order 
        sent unless and until the reference breaks (because of partition -- a 
        communications failure between vats). Once the reference breaks, no further 
        messages are delivered. Therefore, if a particular message does get delivered, 
        E guarantees that all messages sent earlier on the same reference were 
        already delivered.</p>
      <p>As a result, once Alice has sent the message X to Carol, Alice should 
        think of the reference she is now holding as a <i>reference to the Carol 
        that has already seen X</i>. This is true even though Carol has not yet 
        seen X and may never see X. Although Carol hasn't seen X yet, using this 
        reference Alice no longer has any ability to deliver a message to Carol 
        <i>before</i> Carol sees X. Although Carol may never see X, because of 
        a communications failure that Alice doesn't yet know about, if Carol does 
        not see X, then Carol won't see any further messages Alice sends on this 
        reference after X.</p>
      <p> (Note: If Alice and Carol are in the same Vat and Alice has a NEAR reference 
        to Carol, Alice can still <i>immediately call</i> Carol, perhaps delivering 
        a message before messages which were <i>eventually sent </i>earlier. The 
        rest of the page will ignore NEAR references and immediate calls.)</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="tree-order"></a>Three Party Granovetter:<br>
        Tree Order</h1>
      <table width="100%" cellpadding="6">
        <tr height="33%"> 
          <td rowspan="3" valign="top"> 
            <p>The above ordering guarantee is quite useful for Alice -- it allows 
              the Alice-to-Carol protocol to be naively stateful. Unfortunately, 
              we cannot afford these guarantees once there are three parties in 
              three different vats. For example, if Alice shares with Bob her 
              reference to Carol, it would be unreasonable to require that Carol 
              sees the message according to the global-time order in which they 
              are sent by Alice and Bob. It is also unecessary, as Alice and Bob 
              shouldn't care about how their actions are ordered in global time.</p>
            <p>However, without an additional mechanism, our guarantees would 
              be too weak. As explained above, after Alice sends X on her reference 
              to Carol, this reference represents, to her, only the ability to 
              talk to the Carol that has already received X. In a naive implementation, 
              if Alice sends that reference to Bob in message Y, and Bob uses 
              that reference to send message W to Carol, the happenstance of variable 
              network delays may result in W arriving before X. The reference 
              as handed to Bob gave Bob a dangerous possibility -- of delivering 
              a message ahead of X -- that was beyond Alice's notion of the reference's 
              meaning. This would be dangerous.</p>
            <p>Instead, when a reference is included as an argument of an eventually 
              sent message (as Alice's reference to Carol is included in message 
              Y), we say the reference is <i>forked</i>. Bob does not get the 
              reference Alice sent, but a fork of this reference. When a fork 
              occurs between two sending events, we diagram the fork-position 
              on the reference between these two messages. In the diagram on the 
              right, Alice sends, in sequence, X, Y, and Z.</p>
            <p>By following these diagramming rules, we easily visualize the partial 
              ordering guarantees E provides. The tree of messages connected by 
              a reference topology is the partial order itself. </p>
            <p>As of any visualized state, the messages that may be delivered 
              to Carol are those that have no messages ahead of them in the reference 
              topology. In diagrams #1 and #2, this is only message X. The transition 
              to diagram #3 shows message X being delivered to Carol. Following 
              this, we see in diagram #3 that both messages W and Z are candidates 
              to be delivered next. Either choice is consistent with the specification.</p>

      </table>
      <p>With these rules, the message Bob receives from Alice is as safe in Bob's 
        hand as it is in Alice's. The assumptions Alice needs to make for herself, 
        for the sake of her own sanity, are assumptions that remain valid as she 
        delegates to Bob.</p>
      <p>Note that topology is in the specification only, not in the implementation. 
        The implementation is free to deliver messages to Carol in any full order 
        consistent with the specified partial order. It can therefore collapse 
        partial orders to full orders whenever convenient, consistent with these 
        constraints. As Bill Frantz observed, this is one of those rare cases 
        where the specification is much more &quot;expensive&quot; than the implementation.</p>
      <p>Although the motivation for these rules is correctness in the face of 
        error, we do tighten the specification to deal with security in the face 
        of malice as well. Even if Bob is hosted in a tampered vat, VatB, that 
        doesn't &quot;play by the rules&quot;, the protocol must constrain VatB 
        to be unable to deliver a message to Carol ahead of X. The <a href="../capability/ode/ode-protocol.html">simplified 
        protocol explained in the Ode</a> violates this property. VatA must not 
        communicate to VatB the authority to access Carol herself. VatA must communicate 
        only an authority to communicate to a post-X Carol.</p>
