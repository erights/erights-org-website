      <p> This page explains the different kinds of references for purposes of
        accurately understanding message delivery and partial failure. For orientation
        it also provides introductory explanations of how these distinctions affect
        reference equality. Briefly, if a reference is <b>Settled</b>, it supports
        The E language's &quot;==&quot; construct and may be used as a key in
        <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s hashtables. Once you have this page under your belt, if you want more
        information of reference equality and Settled vs Unsettled, proceed to
        <a href="../equality/same-ref.html">When are two references the same?</a>.</p>
      <h2>Horizontal Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>All references are either Sturdy or Live. The following diagrams illustrate
        the possible transitions between the states of a Live reference.</p>
      <p>The most important distinction is that a live reference is either <font color="#006600"><b><font color="#009900">Near</font></b></font>,
        <font color="#000099"><b>Eventual</b></font>, or <font color="#990000"><b>Broken</b></font>.
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/ref-mech-0.gif" width="392" height="403" alt="Simple Ref Taxonomy"></p>
      <p>These Diagrams use David Harel's <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2001/cs4330_spring/misc/harel.pdf"><b><i>Statecharts</i></b></a>
        notation, a generalization of state transition diagrams. In statecharts,
        rounded rectangles represent a state or set of states. Arrows between
        rounded rectangles represent possible state transitions from any of the
        states in the <i>from-set</i> to any of the states in the <i>to-set</i>.
        So the arrow from <b><font color="#000099">Promise</font></b> to <b>Resolved</b>
        means that a <b><font color="#000099">Promise</font></b> may become <font color="#006600"><font color="#009900"><b>Near</b></font></font>,
        <b> <font color="#000099">Far</font></b>, or <font color="#990000"><b>Broken</b></font>.
        Separately, A <b><font color="#000099">Far</font></b> reference may become
        <font color="#990000"><b>Broken</b></font>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A <b><font color="#009900">Near</font></b> reference is the one familiar
            from single machine object programming languages. It is a reference
            arrow in which both head and tail are in the same Vat, and the arrowhead
            is attached to the object being designated. Being Near is a final
            state: once a reference is Near, it is forever Near. Therefore, Near
            references are not susceptible to partition. Near references support
            both immediate calls and eventual sends. Immediate calls are guaranteed
            to reach their recipient. Eventually sent messages are guaranteed
            to be delivered according to the partial-order, except across a checkpoint/revival.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An <font color="#000099"><b>Eventual</b></font> reference is strictly
            weaker than a Near reference. It only supports eventual sends, with
            only a fail-stop guarantee, rather than guaranteed delivery. Fail-stop
            means that, should it ever come to designate an object, it will deliver
            messages to that object according to the partial-order until it fails.
            Once it fails, it will never again deliver any messages, and it will
            eventually become <b><font color="#990000">Broken</font></b>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <b><font color="#990000">Broken</font></b> reference is strictly
            weaker than Eventual or Near references. It does not and never will
            designate an object. Instead, it holds a Throwable to indicate what
            problem caused it not to designate an object. It does not support
            immediate calls -- if one is attempted it throws its problem. It does
            not support eventual sends -- if one is attempted, the result is a
            reference broken by this same problem. Like Near, Broken is a terminal
            state (once Broken always Broken). Broken references are transitively
            immutable and are transitively passed by copy. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 ALIGN="left">Vertical Taxonomy</h1>
      <P ALIGN="left"> A reference is either a <b><font color="#000099">Promise</font></b>
        or <b>Resolved</b>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A <b><font color="#000099">Promise</font></b> is not (yet) locally
            known to designate an object. Messages sent to an Promise are queued,
            awaiting the Promise's resolution. Should the Promise become fulfilled,
            whether to a Near or Far reference, these messages will be delivered
            to that object. The result of an <a href="msg-passing.html#send">eventual-send</a>
            always starts as a Promise for the outcome. Promises are Unsettled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It is locally known whether a <b>Resolved</b> reference designates
            an object or not, and if so, which object it designates. When the
            result of an eventual send becomes Resolved, we know that the request
            has completed, and that the reference now designates its outcome.
            Promises can become Resolved, but once Resolved always Resolved.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>A Resolved reference that isn't Broken is <b>Fulfilled</b> --
                it is known which object it designates, and it will convey messages
                to this object. If the result of an eventual send becomes Fulfilled,
                we know the request succeeded. Whereas if the result becomes Broken,
                either </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>the request reported an exceptional outcome (either by <a href="msg-passing.html#failure">throwing</a>,
                    or by returning a Broken reference), or </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>a network partition prevented the request from arriving,
                    or </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>a network partition prevented the answer from coming back.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>In the latter two cases, the reference the message was sent on

            <li>
              <p>A Resolved Eventual reference is a <b><font color="#000099">Far</font></b>
                reference. A Far reference is locally known to designate a PassByProxy
                object in a remote vat. Messages sent on a Far reference will
                eventually reach that object, unless the Far reference fails because
                of a network partition (communications failure or vat crash) in
                the meantime. The Far reference is Settled, and has the identity
                of the remote object it designates.</p>

      <h1>Detailed Taxonomy</h1>
      <p>There are two kinds of Promises: The LocalPromise and the RemotePromise.
        These further distinctions are mostly of interest to the theoretician
        or E implementor, and will not normally be of concern to the E programmer.
        For most programming purposes, all Promises can be treated alike.</p>
      <p>The result of an eventual-send always starts out as a Promise, either
        a LocalPromise or a RemotePromise depending on whether the message was
        sent intra- or inter-vat. A <b><font color="#000099">LocalPromise</font></b>
        is a promise for which the Resolver is in the same vat. A <b><font color="#000099">RemotePromise</font></b>,
        like a Far reference, crosses vat boundaries. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/ref-mech.gif" width="408" height="461" alt="Ref Taxonomy"></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> A <b><font color="#000099">LocalPromise</font></b> is a reference
            that is locally known to not yet designate any object (as opposed
            to a RemotePromise, which is <i>not yet locally known to</i> designate
            any object). A LocalPromise is a reference arrow in which both tail
            (Ref) and head (Resolver) are in the same vat, but the head isn't
            yet pointing at anything. A LocalPromise is paired with a corresponding
            Resolver, which is used to attach the arrow head to some target object.
            Since it can be attached to anything, a LocalPromise can transition
            to any of the other states. An eventual-send on an intra-vat reference
            will return a LocalPromise as a Promise for the result. A LocalPromise
            can also be created explicitly by using <tt>Ref.promise()</tt>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <b><font color="#000099">RemotePromise</font></b> is a Remote reference
            for which the identity and location of the object to which messages
            are to be delivered isn't yet locally known, and in which the tail
            and head of the reference arrow are not both in the same vat. The
            RemotePromise nevertheless sends messages towards its arrow head in
            the hope that they can be delivered as soon as it is determined who
            the lucky object is. An eventual send on a RemotePromise will return
            a RemotePromise as a promise for the result. Also, when a LocalPromise
            is passed over the network, the receiving vat receives a RemotePromise
            remotely designating the original LocalPromise.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="legend"></a>Expanded Reference Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>So, mixing graphical notations, here is the expanded reference taxonomy:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/ref-taxonomy.gif" width="384" height="653" alt="Expanded Ref Taxonomy"></p>
      <p>Rounded rectangles and the arrows <i>between</i> them, none of whom begin
        with a dot, are to be interpreted according to statechart notation as
        above. <i>Within</i> the leaf rounded rectangles (those that do not contain
        further rounded rectangles) the arrows shown, all of whom begin with dots,
        represent references using our extended Granovetter notation. </p>
      <p>A line without a <b>squiggle</b> is wholly contained within a single
        vat. A line with a squiggle (Remote) isn't, or in the case of a SturdyRef,
        may not be. </p>
      <p>A <b>triangular arrowhead</b> is a reference messages can be sent on.
        These messages move towards the arrowhead, in the hopes of eventually
        being delivered.</p>
      <p>A <b>gray halo</b> around an arrowhead (Promise) means that, although
        the arrowhead is not <i>yet</i> attached to an object, and therefore the
        arrow does not <i>yet</i> point at an object, the arrowhead itself is
        reified as a Resolver object, which can be used to determine whether and
        what the arrow should point at.</p>
      <p>A <b>gray circle</b> attached to an arrowhead is the object the reference
        points at. Elsewhere, we use cirle vs rectangle to distinguish whether
        the pointed-to object is PassByProxy (circle) or PassByConstruction (rectangle).
        (The common case of PassByConstruction is PassByCopy.)</p>
      <p>A <b>slash</b> as arrowhead (Broken) indicates that the reference will
        never point at anything. This always goes with a box on the side which
        is the problem-object (a Throwable presumably explaining why not). While
        messages may still be sent on this reference, they will always simply
        report this problem and be discarded. If a gray circle is shown after
        the slash, it represents the object the reference used to point at before
        it broke, in which case it retains this identity for equality testing
        purposes.</p>
      <p>A <b>diamond</b> as arrowhead (SturdyRef) is &quot;forever&quot;. This
        is the only kind of reference to survive a network partition, and so is
        the means by which connectivity is preserved and consistency recovered
        across such traumas. The price of survival is that a SturdyRef cannot
        directly accept messages, since it cannot guarantee fail-stop delivery:
        See <a href="../distrib/partial-failure.html">Handling Partial Failure</a>.
      </p>
      <h1>Distributed Equality</h1>
      <p>In order to reason about distributed reference equality, yet further
        distinctions are needed. See <a href="../equality/index.html">Equality</a>
        and in particular <a href="../equality/same-ref.html">When are two references
        the same?</a>.</p>
