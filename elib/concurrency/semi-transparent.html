      <p>There have been a variety of attempts at making network programming <i>fully
        transparent</i>, some of which are ancestors of E (<a href="../../history/actors.html">Actors</a>,
        <a href="../../history/fcp.html">Concurrent Logic Programming</a>, Concurrent
        Constraint Programming, Vulcan, <a href="../../history/joule/index.html">Joule</a>).
        <i>Fully transparent</i> means that any correct program written for a
        bunch of objects co-existing in a single addess space will remain correct
        when those objects are distributed over a network, and that any correct
        program written for a bunch of objects distributed over the network will
        remain correct when the objects in question are thrown together in the
        same address space. The computational model of the fully transparent systems
        must include only those feature that can be adequately supported in both
        contexts. </p>
      <p>Carl Hewitt's seminal paper <b><i><a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/221753/0">The
        Challenge of Open Systems</a></i></b> explains the constraints of large
        scale mutually suspicious radically distributed systems. The Kahn and
        Miller <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/13965/0"><b><i>Language
        Design and Open Systems</i></b></a> explains what it means to design fully
        transparent programming languages that satisfy Hewitt's Open Systems constraints.
        All the E ancestors listed above satisfy the design principles listed
        in this paper. At ERights.org, when we refer to distributed computation,
        unless we state otherwise, assume we are talking about the radical distribution
        of Hewitt's Open Systems.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.sun.com/research/techrep/1994/abstract-29.html"><i><b>A
        Note on Distributed Computing</b></i></a> argues, in effect, that the
        costs of these restrictions are too high for general purpose distributed
        computing. While we disagree with many of the particular arguments in
        the paper, we find the conclusions phrased much too strongly, and we find
        the above fully transparent systems much more plausible than this paper
        would suggest, nevertheless, E gives up on full transparency for the same
        reasons as what we take to be the main argument of the paper: There are
        compellingly useful features of local (single machine or single address
        space) computation that are not naturally available for distributed computation.
        It is too expensive to give up these features in the local case, where
        they are cheap; and for many of these, it is impossible or prohibitively
        expensive to support them in the distributed case. In order to support
        them in both cases, we must introduce a semantic non-uniformity between
        the two cases. (For a related but different case against full transparency,
        see Doug Lea's <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/coord/index.html"><b><i>Design
        for Open Systems in Java</i></b></a>.)</p>
      <p>However, we can give up on full transparency without giving up all the
        benefits of transparency. We define <i>semi-transparent</i> network programming
        as the second half of the above definition: <i><b>Any correct program
        written for a bunch of objects distributed over the network will remain
        correct when the objects in question are thrown together in the same address
        space</b></i>. This definition implies that the semantics available in
        the distributed case are a subset of the semantics available locally.
        E is semi-transparent, and &quot;vat&quot; serves the role of &quot;address
        space&quot; in the above definition.</p>
      <p>
      <div align="center"> </div>
      <p>The most compelling cost difference between the intra-vat programming
        and distributed programming has to do with synchrony, latency, concurrency,
        atomicity, and reliability. Among objects in the same vat, the familiar
        synchronous sequential call-return programming, in which the caller waits
        for the callee to return, has the following attributes:</p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Synchrony</b> makes efficient use of the CPU -- it can only do
            one thing at a time anyway</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Adds little <b>latency </b>cost -- as both objects are about equally
            &quot;close&quot; to the CPU.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enables cheap <b>atomicity</b> -- by disallowing other threads in
            the same address space (which is again cheap, as the CPU can only
            do one thing at a time anyway), and by disallowing synchronous communications
            between vats (which is also desireable on other grounds, as we'll
            see below).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Avoids <b>partial failure</b> handling -- a hardware failure cannot
            make some objects in an address space fail without making them all
            fail. The caller does not have to be prepared to react to the disappearance
            of the callee -- any disaster which kills the callee will kill caller
            as well, so it cannot react anyway. And vice versa. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Avoids <b>temporal inconsistency</b> -- Likewise, no hardware failure
            can sever the reference between caller and callee without killing
            them both. Therefore they are always in contact when they should be
            in contact, and can thereby safely make coordinated changes to their
            state.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> By contrast, distributed inter-object invocation should be based on
        asynchronous one-way non-fully-reliable pipelined messages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Asynchrony</b>: The sender should send and continue, without waiting
            for a reply. This allows both processors to proceed in parallel. As
            is conventional in distributed systems analysis, time between vats
            must first be understood as a partial causal order, where the inter-vat
            messages are the causality links. The computation that happens is
            equivalent to any full order consistent with this partial order.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Latency</b>: Pipes can be made wider but not shorter -- new technologies
            will give us ever more bandwidth, but they may never repeal the speed
            of light. Therefore, the need for network round trips should be kept
            to a minimum -- it must be reasonable to express distributed algorithms
            whose implementation requires no more round trips than reasonably
            necessary. <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s promise-based
            <a href="../distrib/pipeline.html">promise pipelining</a> allows computation
            to &quot;use&quot; the results of previous remote messages before
            these results have come back.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Mutual exclusion</b>: While inter-machine mutual exclusion is
            very expensive (and under mutual suspicion, it's often prohibitively
            expensive), intra-vat mutual exclusion is free. Distributed computational
            patterns should make good use of this asymmetry, and our foundations
            should help us write such patterns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Partial failure</b>: Communication lines can temporarily go out,
            partitioning one part of the network from another. Machine can fail:
            in a transient fashion, rolling back to a previous stable state; or
            permanently, making the objects they host forever inaccessible. From
            a machine not able to reach a remote object, it is generally impossible
            to tell which of these failure scenarios is occurring. The system
            as a whole must smoothly continue in the face of these kinds of problems.
            It must be reasonably possible to write distributed apps whose surviving
            parts continue to provide valuable service while other parts are inaccessible.
            See <a href="../distrib/partial-failure.html">Partial Failure Handling</a>
            for more details.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Temporal inconsistency</b>: Once you write parts of an app to function
          in the face such inaccessibility of other parts, then these parts proceed
          forward and change state while out of contact. This conflicts with the
          strategy normally advocated by distributed systems designers for failure
          recovery: transparent masking of failure. You cannot simultaneously
          hide from the app the occurrence of failure while also allowing it to
          react to failure in order to continue functioning. E chooses failure-visibility.
          (By contrast, distributed databases typically choose failure-masking,
          which means their apps can get wedged during a partition.) The burden
          of choosing failure-visibility is that E must provide the programmer
          tools that can be used reliably at reasonable effort to recover distributed
          consistency on their own. Given the visibility of failure, such recovery
          is necessarily specific to the semantics of a given distributed app.</li>
      </ul>
      <P>E handles this set of differences by adding surprisingly few new abstractions
        to the conventional set of single-addess space sequential pure object
        programming abstractions. In addition to the conventional <i><font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font></i>
        reference, having all the synchrony and reliability properties available
        in a single address space, E introduces a <a href="refmech.html">reference
        taxonomy</a> of other reference types including the <i><font color="#000099"><b>EVENTUAL</b></font></i>
        reference, which is the only kind that can span address spaces. In addition
        to the conventional message passing taxonomy of synchronous <i>call</i>-return
        control-flow constructs, which E only allows over conventional <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>
        references, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s <a href="msg-passing.html">message passing taxonomy</a>
        introduces the <i>eventual send</i>, which works over both <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>
        and <b><font color="#000099">EVENTUAL</font></b> references.
      <P>The properties of <b><font color="#000099">EVENTUAL</font></b> references
        reflect the inescapable issues of distributed systems. However, the programmer
        doesn't need to know whether a reference is <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>
        or <b><font color="#000099">EVENTUAL</font></b>. In keeping with the principle
        of semi-transparency, when the programmer doesn't know, it is always correct
        to treat a reference as if it is <b><font color="#000099">EVENTUAL</font></b>.
        You only need to know a reference is <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>
        if you want to use some functionality available only on <font color="#009900"><b>NEAR</b></font>
        references -- like synchronous calling.

      <p>At first, these last two picture may look identical but for the color
        change. But notice the reversal of the outcome arrow. As explained in
        <a href="msg-passing.html">Message Passing</a>, the lightning bolt is
        the stack-frame in Alice in which she emitted a message to Bob. On the
        left, the arrow goes from the <i>continuation</i> part of the message
        to the stack-frame, implying that the stack-frame waits for a response
        to be sent to it along this arrow. </p>
      <p>On the right, nothing points at the sending stack-frame, so it continues
        after emitting the message. Moreover, this stack-frame continues holding
        a promise for the outcome of the message -- the tail of the arrow -- even
        though the outcome itself hasn't been determined yet. The arrowhead with
        the gray halo is the ability to determine the resolution of the promise.
        It serves in the continuation-role of the message delivered to Bob. Messages
        sent on the arrowtail of a reference always move towards the arrowhead,
        even while the arrowhead is en-route. This is the basis for <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s
        <a href="../distrib/pipeline.html">Promise Pipelining</a>. </p>
      <p>When Bob finishes reacting to a message, he reports an outcome to the
        message's continuation. On the left, Alice's stack-frame resumes by reacting
        to Bob's report. On the right, Bob's report resolves the promise that
        Alice holds -- the outcome of processing the message beomes the object
        designated by the reference.</p>
