      <p align="left">Taken together, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s <a href="msg-passing.html">Message Passing
        rules</a> impose the familiar LIFO stack discipline within an turn. All
        synchronously accessible side effects brought about by the callee are
        done before the caller continues. In the example code above, result is
        not bound to a value until and unless the callee returns successfully,
        and the "stuff after call" will execute in the context of whatever synchronous
        side effects were caused by the callee. </p>
      <p align="left">The synchronous processing of a pending delivery, an event
        of our event loop, we call a <i>turn</i>. If the state of a vat is like
        the state of a game board, then in both cases, the state evolves only
        because of a sequence of turns, and each turn executes with mutually exclusive
        access to this state, and it executes to completion before before the
        next turn starts. </p>
      <p align="left">Although other Vats are executing concurrently, a caller
        will only see synchronous side effects caused by its callee. Because Vats
        are only asynchronously coupled to each other, an E turn implicitly has
        full mutual exclusion on all state to which it has synchronous access
        -- which is only state within its Vat. As a result, E execution is not
        observably distinguishable (except for timing and the effects of infinite
        loops) from an implementation in which, across the universe, only one
        Vat at a time takes a turn. <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s turns are therefore atomic serializable
        micro-transactions, and E is strongly consistency preserving in the face
        of concurrency, without any error-prone fine-grained locking.
      <p align="left">We say <i>micro-transaction</i> above because we purposely
        unbundle or avoid the features combined by the classic ACID transaction:
      <p align="left">
      <ol>
        <li>While a Vat is only committed to stable storage (checkpointed) between
          turns, because disk seeks are so expensive compared to computation,
          a Vat is checkpointed much less often than once per turn.
          <p>
        </li>
        <li>Unlike many systems, E doesn't claim to provide distributed atomic
          transactions. But seeing as how these are provably unimplementable (see
          the <a href="http://hpc.serc.iisc.ernet.in/%7Ekama/lec7/sld013.htm">Coordinated
          Attack Problem</a>), this might not be the loss it seems. Although one
          can build distributed mutual exclusion protocols on top of E, good E
          style is to avoid these like the plague. Indeed, we have so far only
          encountered one practical application that demanded it (ref ** The Communities.com
          Containership problem). <a href="../distrib/partial-failure.html">Handling
          Partial Failures</a> explains <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s very different approach to recovering
          distributed consistency following network partitions or rollbacks.
          <p>
        </li>
        <li>There is no facility for aborting a turn and automatically undoing
          its side effects. Instead, one can manually use the <a href="../../elang/kernel/FinallyExpr.html">try-finally
          expession</a> to undo some side effects while unwinding a non-local
          exit. </li>
      </ol>
      <h1 align="left">Chronological Encapsulation</h1>
      <p align="left">
        <blockquote><i><b>Event loops are better even than purely sequential programming
          at maintaining consistency</b></i></blockquote>
      <p align="left">To illustrate this radical claim, consider the classic Observer
        pattern (or "Listener" in Java, "Dependent" in Smalltak). In the Observer
        pattern, an object interested in the occurrence of some condition (an
        observer) requests of some object in a position to know when that condition
        comes about (the observable), that the observable notify it when this
        happens. A simple example is an observable variant of the Slots used by
        <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s scopes to hold the values of variables, and is written in E as follows:
      <p align="left">
      <blockquote>
        <pre>def observableSlot {
    to makeSlot(var value, _) :near {
        var observers := []
        def self {
            to addObserver(observer) {
                observers += [observer]
            }
            to getValue() :any {value}
            to setValue(newValue) {
                for observer in observers {
                    observer &lt;- valueChanged(newValue)
                }
                value := newValue
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><tt>observableSlot</tt> can be used for one-way eventual
        constraint programming, as it allows a perpetually evaluating expression
        to be informed when one of its inputs change. It's definition looks much
        as we'd expect in other object languages, but with differences. First,
        we are using a send rather than a call, even though the problem we're
        trying to solve doesn't mention concurrency. If we wrote it as a call,
        then the side effects produced by the observers would occur before the
        observable variable's assigner returned from the assignment. The code
        containing the assignment was likely written without taking the possibility
        of such side effects in mind, and this is as it should be.
      <p align="left">When Alice passes a message to Bob in order to subcontract
        part of her plan to Bob, she is invoking Bob on her own behalf, and so
        would often want to wait for Bob's side effects and outcome. The immediate
        call does precisely this. When Alice passes a message to Bob on Bob's
        behalf, as when Alice is an observable and Bob is an observer, this courtesy
        provided to Bob should be minimally disruptive to Alice. The send above
        queues, on the queue of the observer's vat, a pending delivery of a <tt>valueChanged()</tt>
        message to this observer. This delivery will happen in its own separate
        turn, and cannot affect the turn from which it was sent.
      <p align="left">We can now understand why the other peculiar thing in the
        above code is harmless: To illustrate our point, we put the actual assignment
        after the loop notifying the observers. If we were calling the observers
        instead, we'd need to remember to be careful to change to the new state
        first, before allowing any of the observers to run, lest they interact
        with the observable prior to this internal assignment. Even without concurrency
        in the picture, this worry still has the form "but what if, while I'm
        proceeding with plan X, someone else proceeds with a conflicting plan
        Y which messes me up?" Whether it comes from concurrency or not, the need
        for such worries just makes programming too hard. (It also makes it much
        harder for security reviews to check for <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-review/security-review.html#concurrency">TOCTTOU
        errors</a>.)
      <p align="left">The eventual send enables us to isolate conceptually separate
        plans into separate atomic turns, enabling us to avoid more cases of <a href="event-loop.html#safety">plan
        interference</a>. We term this the principle of <i>chronological encapsulation</i>.
