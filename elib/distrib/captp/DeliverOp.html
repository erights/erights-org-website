      <P ALIGN="left">An inter-vat eventual send which returns a promise for the 
        outcome of the send. 
      <P ALIGN="left">Like <a href="DeliverOnlyOp.html">DeliverOnlyOp</a>, but 
        also makes the result available at answerPos, and simulates the receiving 
        of an immediately following 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>DeliverOnlyOp(answerPos,
              &quot;whenMoreResolved&quot;,
              [redirector]) </pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The following explanation assumes you've already read the <a href="DeliverOnlyOp.html">DeliverOnlyOp</a> 
        page. </p>
      <p>The imported far reference is expected to designate the redirector for 
        resolving the question at the sending side's (Alice's) answerPos.</p>
      <p align="left">This corresponds to a remote message send in which the sender 
        needs a promise for the outcome. In ELib this is expressed by using <tt>E.send(..)</tt> 
        rather than <tt>E.sendOnly(..</tt>). Unlike <tt>E.sendOnly(..)</tt>, <tt>E.send(..)</tt> 
        is declared as returning a Ref. 
      <p align="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>Ref xVow = E.send(bob, &quot;foo&quot;, carol);</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">In the E language, this is indirectly expressed by using 
        a &quot;<tt>&lt;-</tt>&quot; (eventual send) expression in a context where 
        it is statically apparent that its value may be needed. (<font color="#FF0000">***</font> 
        need to say this more precisely.) For example, the following send 
      <p align="left"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>def xVow := bob &lt;- foo(carol)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">clearly should be implemented as a <tt>send</tt>, since 
        its result is needed. 
      <p align="left">For concreteness, we'll step through an example in which 
        Carol is a <tt>PassByProxy</tt> object residing in the same vat as Alice, 
        and in which the Bob's result in response to the &quot;<tt>foo</tt>&quot; 
        message is the number &quot;<tt>3</tt>&quot;, a <tt>PassByCopy</tt> object. 
      <h1 align="left">Example Scenario</h1>
      <p align="left"><a href="#step1">Click here</a> to position the first frame 
        of the animation sequence. Then click on each diagram to proceed to the 
        next diagram.</p>
      <table width="100%" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="12">
        <tr>
          <td><a name="step1" href="#step2"><img
        src="images/deliver_1.gif" width="558" height="794" border="1"
        alt="Deliver Step 1" align="right"></a> 
      <p align="left">The bottom of this diagram is much like the <a href="DeliverOnlyOp.html#step1">corresponding 
        diagram</a> in DeliverOnlyOp. But where the other diagram has a <img src="images/bar_sinister.gif" width="22" height="23" align="middle" alt="Bar Sinister"> 
        indicating no place to report an outcome, this diagram has the Resolver 
        facet of a promise-pair (arrowhead with halo). The promise facet of this 
        pair (the arrowtail) is returned by the send operation to Alice's activation 
        frame, and in this example, held in local variable xVow. The Resolver 
        is the right to determine what object the arrowhead is pointed at, and 
        therefore what object xVow will come to designate.</p>
      <p align="left">As far as DeliverOp is concerned, the remote reference to 
        Bob may be a Far reference or a RemotePromise, and (if it's a RemotePromise) 
        it may be an import or a question. For concreteness, this example shows 
        Bob as an imported Far reference.</p>
      <p align="left">On receiving the message, the Far reference serializes the 
        arguments for transmission to the other side. Any PassByCopy arguments 
        are simply serialized so that identical copies will be unserialized. However, 
        Carol, we are supposing, is a PassByProxy object, so Alice's vat registers 
        her in the Exports table for this connection, thereby allocating her an 
        export/import position.</p>
            <p align="left">The outcome Resolver is not an argument to be serialized. 
              (We could have treated it that way, but if we had, we'd lose the 
              <a href="../pipeline.html">pipelining effect</a>.) Instead, Alice's 
              vat creates a new Question (a RemotePromise in VatA's Questions 
              table) for Bob's to answer. The redirector facet of this question 
              will be used to resolve it. This facet is itself an exported PassByProxy 
              object entered into VatA's Exports table.</p>

      <p align="left">The message is no longer represented out of in-address-space 
        programming language material, but rather as encoded bits on the wire, 
        in-flight to Bob's vat. The encoding is the integer that represents DeliverOp, 
        followed by Bob's position in the Exports table, followed by the encoding 
        of Carol.</p>
            <p align="left">To represent the optimistic return result, two arguments 
              are needed. <tt>xPos</tt> creates the arrow going from VatA to VatB, 
              which directly represents the unresolved reference to the return 
              result. Until this reference is resolved, messages sent on this 
              reference will travel, as expected, from VatA to VatB. (Message 
              sent on a reference travel towards the arrowhead in anticipation 
              of eventually being delivered.) In addition, <tt>NewFarDesc(xRdrPos,xRdrSwiss)</tt> 
              creates an arrow going from VatB to the redirector of this unresolved 
              x reference. This is used by VatB to report the resolution of VatB's 
              side of the x reference to VatA, in order for VatA to resolve its 
              x' reference.</p>

      <p align="left">This concludes the explanation of DeliverOp per se. We now 
        continue with the scenario, so that we see an example of how DeliverOp 
        set things up for other operations to proceed in its wake.</p>
      <h2 align="left">Resolving the Promise for an Answer</h2>
            <p align="left">This network message is decoded into an in-address-space 
              message made out of proganmming language material and eventually-sent 
              to Bob. In other words, it is queued as if by &quot;<tt>&lt;-</tt>&quot; 
              for delivery to Bob. The argument of the decoded message is the 
              Far reference to Carol that resulted from decoding the encoding 
              of the NewFarDesc. The message is a <tt>send</tt> kind of message 
              (rather than a <tt>sendOnly</tt>), in that it will report the outcome

      <p align="left">The redirector reacts to this <tt>run(3)</tt> message by 
        arranging for its xVow become a resolved reference to <tt>3</tt>. In other 
        words, all references to xVow are now references to <tt>3</tt>, and xVow

            <p align="left">In order to maintain <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s 
              partial ordering guarantees in the face of a possible race condition, 
              the redirector will not generally be able to arrange for this in 
              one step, as will be explained on <a href="resolving.html">Resolving 
              RemotePromises</a>. For simplicity here, we assume that no messages 
              have been sent through xVow between it creation and its attempted 
              redirection, so that it can know not to worry about the race condition. 
              This special case allows the redirector to safely immediately redirect 
              on reception of the run(3) message, as shown below.</p>

<h2 align="left">Distributed Acyclic Garbage Collection (<a href="dagc.html">DAGC</a>)</h2>
            <p align="left">When the redirector redirects xVow, the position, 
              xPos, occupied by xVow in VatA's Questions table and in VatB's Answers 
              table can be deallocated as well. The entry in VatA's Questions 
              table is immediately deallocated, and VatA sends a &quot;<tt><a href="GCAnswerOp.html">GCAnswerOp</a>(xPos)</tt>&quot; 
              to VatB. </p>
            <p align="left">For a while now, in this scenario, VatB's far reference 
              to the x redirector, shown as a half circle labeled rdr', has not 
              been pointed at by anything else in VatB. As a result, VatB's local 
              garbage collector will eventually notice that it is garbage and 
              should be collected, and notify the local Imports table. (This requires 
              a local garbage collector with finalization, which Java &gt;= 1.2 
              fortunately provides well.) When the Imports table receives this 
              notification, it does <i>not</i> deallocate its entry, for reasons 
              explained below, but does send a &quot;<tt><a href="GCExportOp.html">GCExportOp</a>(xRdrPos, 
              wireCount)</tt>&quot; to the other side with its current wireCount, 
              and then zeros its own wireCount. The wireCounts exists to solve 
              a race condition problem that will be explained at <a href="GCExportOp.html">GCExportOp</a>, 
              but in this scenrio it suffices to say that the sent wireCount will 
              be &quot;<tt>1</tt>&quot;. </p>
            <p align="left">When VatA's Answers table receives the &quot;<tt>GCAnswerOp(xPos)</tt>&quot;, 
              it immediately deallocates its corresponding entry. The GCAnswerOp 
              case is simple, because the same side -- the Questions table -- 
              both allocates a position, decides to reuse it, and obtains the 
              information that it is no longer locally needed, so the Answers 
              table can simply follow the Questions table's instructions.</p>
            <p align="left">Unfortunately, VatB's Import table's reaction to the 
              local finalization notification cannot be as simple, and neither 
              can VatA's Exports table's reaction to the resulting GCExportOp. 
              The Exports table is where alocation and reuse decisions happen, 
              so it also needs to be where deallocation decisions happen, or we 
              get a difficult race condition. But we also create a race condition 
              by having the Exports side make deallocation decisions in reactions 
              to GC-finalization notifications received at the Imports table. 
              Fortunately, this latter race condition is easily solved by the 
              extra <tt>wireCount</tt> argument, as will be explained on <a href="GCExportOp.html">GCExportOp</a>.</p>
            <p align="left">In the current scenario, the race does not occur, 
              so VatA's Exports table, on receiving the &quot;<tt>GCExportOp(xRdrPos, 
              1)</tt>&quot;, determines that the &quot;1&quot; is adequate, and 
              deallocates the corresponding Exports table entry. Note that the 
              Imports table does <i>not</i> deallocate the Imports table entry, 
              since it doesn't know the Exports table's decision. However, should 
              the Exports table reallocate that position, it will send a new <a href="NewFarDesc.html">NewFarDesc</a> 
              or <a href="NewRemotePromiseDesc.html">NewRemotePromiseDesc</a> 
              to the Imports table reusing the same position, at which time the 
              Imports table will overwrite its entry.</p>
            <p align="left">Once all these steps have taken place, we are left 
              in the state shown in the next diagram, which is stable but for 
              the gray diamond redirector will be garbage collected by the local 
              garbage collector.</p>
