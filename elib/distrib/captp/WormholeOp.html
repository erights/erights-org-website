      <h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="conflict"></a>The Conflict Solved by WormholeOp</h1>
      <p>Without the WormholeOp, there are a set of requirements in the E semantics 
        that are individually quite sensible and compelling, but that jointly 
        seem to be impossible:</p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p><a name="partial-order"></a><a href="../../concurrency/partial-order.html#tree-order"><b>Partial 
            ordering</b></a>: In a 3-vat Granovetter introduction, that the forked 
            reference sent to Bob gives Bob access only to post-X Carol, only 
            enabling messages from Bob to arrive at Carol after X is delivered. 
            (Even without the WormholeOp, the current implementations of E meet 
            this requirement.)</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><b><a name="simple-servers"></a>Allow services with Near arguments</b>. 
            In order to allow services like the <a href="../../capability/ode/ode-capabilities.html#simple-money">MintMaker</a> 
            to be correct when written this simply, we allow it to require its 
            arguments, such as the src argument of the deposit message, to be 
            Near. Of course, this requirement can only be satisfied when the argument 
            Purse is in the same vat as the receiving Purse, but that is the case 
            here for any valid argument Purse, so no problem. Further, remote 
            clients need to be able to ensure that the argument as delivered is 
            Near, even though the argument as sent cannot be. For this we adopt 
            the argument passing rule &quot;<a href="../../equality/passing-rules.html#going-home">Going 
            Home</a>&quot; that says a Far reference (a Resolved remote reference) 
            sent as an argument in a message sent to the designated object's hosting 
            vat arrives as a Near reference.</p>
          <p>In the absence of this requirement, since clients could not ensure 
            that arguments arrive Near, the remotely invokable interfaces of the 
            MintMaker would always have to deal with the possibility of Eventual 
            arguments. It could wait on these arguments, and put the previous 
            method body in a when/catch clause, but it's worse than that. In a 
            deposit followed by a withdraw, the withdraw should not fail for insufficient 
            funds if the deposit would have provided these funds, just because 
            the deposit hasn't been scheduled yet. This would necessitate rather 
            complex postponement logic in the MintMaker. But much of the goal 
            of E is to enable simple secure distributed services to be coded simply. 
            Therefore, this requirement seems necessary. (Even without the WormholeOp, 
            the current implementations of E meet this requirement.)</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><b><a name="passability"></a>Preserve passability</b>. A PassByCopy 
            object that contains only passable parts should be passable by copy 
            between vats. The problem here is a hashtable-based PassByCopy collection, 
            T, (whether the current <a href="../../../elang/collect/tables.html">EMap</a> 
            or the anticipated <a href="http://www.waterken.com/Hydro/2.0/doc/abridged-index.html">Hydro</a>-based 
            replacement) that has as one of it's keys a PassByProxy object, let's 
            say Carol in VatC. If T is passed to Alice in VatA, everything's cool, 
            and it arrives with a Far reference to Carol as its key. However, 
            if Alice were to further pass this to Bob in VatB, then, in order 
            for T to still be operational at the moment of arrival, this key would 
            have to arrive as a Settled remote reference to Carol, which is to 
            say, a Far reference. (For reasons explained below, E won't do this 
            until the WormholeOp is implemented. Instead, in current E implementations, 
            the reference to Carol will arrive as an Unresolved remote reference 
            (a RemotePromise), and therefore T will fail to unserialize. This is the 
            <a href="../../equality/passing-rules.html#lost-resolution">Lost Resolution</a> 
            bug.)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The conflict arises when, in the Preserve Passability scenario, Alice 
        had sent messages (like X) to Carol that hadn't yet arrived in Carol's 
        vat when she sends T to Bob. The reference to Carol that Bob gets in T 
        must be &quot;behind&quot; X, which would seem to make it different than 
        other Resolved references Bob might have to Carol. However, since this 
        new references is Resolved as well, if Bob includes it as an argument 
        in a message to Carol's vat, it must arrive as a Near reference to Carol. 
        However, because Near references give immediate access, it may not arrive 
        as a Near references until all prior messages, such as X from Alice, have 
        drained out.</p>

            reference is a Settled but not Resolved remote reference to a PassByProxy 
            object. Dean, MarcS, and I (MarkM) actually worked out the semantics 
            for this, and earlier in the CVS history you'll find some corresponding 
            taxonomy diagrams and explanations, but it just made E too hard to 
            explain.</p>

            to the introduction have drained out, or until the VatA/VatC timeout 
            period expires, killing the connection. This could repeatedly impose 
            a huge cost on VatB for the sake of only a few objects in VatB. While 
            E avoids making any claims about resistance to denial of service attack, 
            this would be too egregious a vulnerability to such an attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p><a name="WormholeOp"></a><b>WormholeOp</b>. When VatA introduces 
            VatB to Carol, she first wormholes the unacknowledged portion of her 
            outgoing VatA-to-VatC VatTP stream through VatB for delivery to VatC. 
            VatB then wormholes it towards VatC before acting on further messages 
            from VatA. VatTP already encrypts this traffic for secrecy, integrity, 
            authenticity, and protection against replay attacks, so that this 
            communications can be carried by untrusted intermediaries. VatB is 
            just another untrusted intermediary. If VatC gets the next communication 
            in the VatA/VatC stream via a wormhole from VatB, that's fine. It 
            doesn't matter where the bits came from, as long as they pass all 
            the crypto tests. When these same bits come in redundantly through 
            another path, they may be safely ignored.</p>

        is the current expectation.</p>
      <h1><a name="scenario"></a>Wormhole Introduction Scenario</h1>
      <p>The Wormhole introduction is only needed when VatA sends to VatB a Far 
        reference for an object on VatC. It isn't needed for any 2-vat introductions, 
        and it isn't needed when the reference passed from VatA to VatB is Unresolved, 
        such as a RemotePromise whose Resolver is on VatC, or is travelling to 
        VatC.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">*** To be written</font>, but involves these CapTP 
        steps:</p>
      <p>VatA to VatC:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>def vine := NonceLocator &lt;- provideFor(farCarol,
                                       vatBID,
                                       nonce,
                                       carolSwissHash)</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>VatA to VatB:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>
WormholeOp(<font class="comment">/*unacknowledged encrypted A-to-C traffic*/</font>,
           vatAID,
           vatCID)
<font class="comment">/*some message containing: */
</font>... Far3Desc(VatCSearchPath,
             VatCID,
             nonce,
             carolSwissHash,
             vine) ...</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>VatB to VatC:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>WormholeOp(<font class="comment">/*unacknowledged encrypted A-to-C traffic*/</font>,
           vatAID,
           vatCID)
<font class="comment"></font>def carolPromise := NonceLocator &lt;- acceptFrom(vatAID,
                                               nonce,
                                               carolSwissHash,
                                               vine)</pre>
        /* carolPromise, a RemotePromise, is then magically turned into farCarol, 
        a Far reference. */</blockquote>
      <p>If VatB fails to deliver the wormhole data to VatC, then the 
        <code>acceptFrom</code> message will either arrive too early and find no
        reference to Carol (fail safe), or arrive after the <code>provideFor</code>,
        and thus after the preceding messages to VatC (correct partial ordering).</p>
      <p>So, if VatA and VatB are cooperative, they are both assured that the 
        needed <tt>provideFor</tt> &quot;from&quot; VatA will be processed 
        by VatC before VatC sees the corresponding <tt>acceptFrom</tt> from 
        VatB. If either is uncooperative, they cannot cause damage beyond that 
        accounted for by the object-level semantics. Because the data takes redundant 
        paths, neither side will get stuck waiting on the other to timeout.</p>
