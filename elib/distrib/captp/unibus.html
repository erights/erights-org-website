      <p>It seems the E project has given the impression that cryptographic capabilities
        are <i>necessarily</i> based on public key cryptography. Indeed, it has
        been claimed that the security properties of capabilities can only be
        understood in terms of their mapping to public key constructs + the security
        properties of these public key constructs themselves. </p>
      <p> To demonstrate the independence of capabilities from public key, here
        is the outline of a protocol for distributed cryptographic capabilities,
        with the capability security properties defined <a href="../../capability/ode/index.html">here</a>,
        but implemented using only single key cryptography with no centrally trusted
        party of any sort. This protocol may be impractical for various non-security
        engineering reasons (implicit storage obligations vs garbage collection,
        handling of race conditions, support for off-line capabilities, etc),
        but it is security-equivalent to the PK-based protocol, Pluribus, we present
        in the above paper and <a href="../index.html">here</a>. A practical version
        of the following single-key protocol may be derivable from the following
        sketch.
      <p>Because it is a single key variant of Pluribus, and in fond memory of
        the PDP-11, we name this protocol Unibus.
      <h1>Supporting Only Pure Capabilities</h1>
      <p>Let's talk the protocol through using the same diagram we use to talk
        through Pluribus:
      <p align="center"><img src="../../capability/ode/images/numberpair.gif" width="543" height="540" alt="Distributed Shortening Granovetter">
      <p>Once again, we are concerned with inductive correctness, so assume there
        is already a secure connection set up between VatA and VatB, as well as
        one between VatA and VatC. But not yet between VatB and VatC. Following
        the methodology of inductive correctness, these connections have the same
        security properties as the connection we will forge between VatB and VatC.
      <p> Note: by "private key" I mean shared secret information adequate for
        a running SSL-like connection, including encryption key (eg triple DES),
        MAC, and initialization vector.
      <p> In step 1, proxy b1, seeing an argument which is a proxy to a different
        remote vat, generates a new secret key K which it sends over the existing
        secure channels to both VatB and VatC. It sends K to VatB <i>as</i> the
        network representation of the Carol argument of this message (step 2).
        It also sends K to VatC in a message meaning "expect someone to contact
        Carol using this K". Since this step doesn't correspond to anything on
        the existing diagram, let's call it step 2a.
      <p> This private key, K, substitutes for the "VatID + SwissNumber" on the
        diagram.
      <p> In step 3, VatB contacts the alleged VatC according to TCP/IP hint information
        exactly analogous to this aspect of Pluribus. However, on contact, the
        handshake proceeds differently. VatB states a hash of the secret, K, it
        supposedly shares with the alleged VatC, and then simply begins an SSL-like
        session, post handshake, starting from state 0. VatB would send a first
        test message on this session and await a response before creating proxy
        c2. If VatC is an impostor, then VatC will not be able to decrypt any
        of VatB's communication, and will not be able to send data which MAC-authenticates.
      <p> If alleged VatC sends back a response that VatB MAC-authenticates, then
        VatB creates proxy c2 and (step 4) delivers to Bob an object message with
        c2 as argument. Any messages sent to c2 are encoded and sent to Carol
        over our newly constructed SSL-like channel, just like the original message
        to b1 was encoded and sent to Bob.
      <p> Now this protocol has one huge apparently fatal problem whose explanation
        does much to uncover some hidden assumptions. The apparent problem: VatA
        also knows the shared secret and can therefore be a MITM between Bob and
        Carol. VatB cannot authenticate that it is "really" VatC that he is now
        speaking to, rather than VatA. However, this doesn't matter. We state
        the capability authentication criteria <a href="../../capability/ode/ode-protocol.html">here</a>:
      <p>
        <blockquote>A capability is an arrow, and an arrow has two ends. There
          is an impostor problem in both directions. The VatID ensures that the
          entity that Bob is speaking to is the one that Alice meant to introduce
          him to. The Swiss number ensures that the entity allowed to speak to
          Carol is the one that Alice chose to enable to do so. </blockquote>
      <p>Though the Unibus protocol doesn't use VatIDs and SwissNumbers, it accomplishes
        this goal. If VatA wants to play MITM, then this MITM is the entity that
        she intended Bob to speak to, and the one she wished to enable to speak
        to Carol. This is logically- and security-equivalent to a situation that
        the objects could have expressed in the formalism. This is what we mean
        by "This is the main economy of the distributed capability model: we can,
        without loss of generality, reason as if we are only suspicious of objects."
        Alice could have explicitly set up a transparent forwarder object to Carol
        that also displayed all messages going by to Alice. Alice could have given
        Bob a reference to this object rather than c1. Expressing this in E, Alice
        in the non-MITM scenario would say:
      <pre>     bob.foo(c1) </pre>
      <p> whereas, in the MITM scenario, Alice would say:
      <pre>
     def MITM match [verb, args] {
         observe(verb, args)
         E.send(c2, verb, args)
     }
     bob.foo(MITM)

</pre>
      <p> The requires a bit of explanation. The "<tt>def ... match ...</tt>"
        form is used to define a <a href="../../../elang/kernel/PlumbingExpr.html">plumbing
        object</a> that can receive all messages sent to it generically, as a
        verb (the message name as a string) and a list of arguments. (This is
        as opposed to the normal object practice of dispatching on the message
        name.)
      <p> The "<tt>E.send(<i>receiver</i>, <i>verb</i>, <i>args</i>)</tt>" form
        is used to send a message generically. Therefore, the above two actions
        by Alice are behaviorally equivalent (so far) as far as Bob can tell.
        This protocol so far is a perfect implementation of pure capabilities
        without either a <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/ode/ode-capabilities.html#rights-amp">rights
        amplification primitive</a> or an <a href="../../equality/grant-matcher/index.html">equality
        primitive</a>, in that the protocol displays exactly the same vulnerability
        as such un-augmented pure capability systems.
      <h1>Supporting Equality</h1>
      <p> However, all capability advocates advocate capability systems augmented
        with either or both of the above primitives -- rights amplification or
        equality. It seems that given either one, one can build the security-equivalent
        of the other, but without either you cannot build either. Most capability
        systems, including KeyKOS, EROS, and E, add equality as a primitive. Joule
        adds rights amplification as primitive, and has no primitive notion of
        equality. <a href="../../equality/grant-matcher/index.html">The Grant
        Matcher Puzzle</a> explains, at the object level, how equality makes it
        meaningful for Bob to cut out MITM between him and Carol. (Bob == Grant
        Matcher, and Carol == KEQD.)
      <p> When, in E, Bob wishes to compare c2, the proxy representing the capability
        to Carol received from Alice, with, let's say, c3, the proxy representing
        the capability to Carol received from Dana, he would say:
      <pre>    def c4 := E.join(c2, c3) </pre>
      <p> Security-free synchronization issues aside, this either returns to Bob
        a new object reference that he can trust to designate both whatever c2
        designates (to the satisfaction of introducer Alice) and whatever c3 designates
        (to the satisfaction of introducer Dana), or, if it cannot, it gives an
        exception. This is the only trust-combining primitive in <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. In its absence,
        all references are received from a particular introducer, and can never
        be more trusted than is that introducer. With the primitive, the trust
        Bob can invest in c4 is a combination of the trust he can invest in c2
        and c3, since c4 is <i>mutually acceptable</i> to both introducers as
        an interpretation of what they intend to designate. As the page explains,
        were Alice to pass her own MITM to Bob as in the above code, where that
        MITM is unacceptable to Dana, the above <tt>join()</tt> would fail.
      <p> How can we enhance our single-key protocol to support an equality primitive
        with security properties sufficient to support grant matching? There are
        many ways, all of which seem equivalent. For example, VatB could make
        up yet another secret key, xor it with a random mask, send the mask to
        c2 and the xored secret key to c3, both with a hash of the new secret
        key so that VatC can tell the two messages are "meant for each other".
        If VatC receives both messages and knows they are in regard to the same
        C-hosted object, eg, Carol, then VatC recovers the secret by xoring, verifies
        it against the hash (just a sanity check) and prepares to receive a connection
        request to Carol via this new secret, just as she did between steps 2a
        and 3 above. VatB meanwhile attempts to connect to the Carol designated
        by this secret key, just as in step 3 above. Should he succeed, VatB creates
        proxy c4 to represent the new connection.
      <p> This protocol protects against against MITM exactly when and how the
        object-level model says it should.
      <p> If anyone is interested, I can also explain a very painful and horribly
        impractical protocol which achieves cryptographic capability security
        + equality without a centrally trusted anything using only one time pads.
        I invented this back when I was worried that quantum computation may give
        us a general exponential speedup. One-time pads are the only currently
        realizable cryptography I am aware of that doesn't rely on assumptions
        of future computational limits. Given exponentially greater compute &amp;
        communication, some variant of the protocol I have in mind might even
        be practical. Fortunately, it now looks like we don't need to worry about
        this.
      <p> And in any case, by presenting a single-key implementation of cryptographic
        capabilities + equality, I hope I have demonstrated that capabilities
        are independent of PK is the same sense that digital logic gates are independent
        of solid-state transistors. Both PK and transistors may be the substrates
        of choice, but other substrates are possible.
