      <p>In a conventional RPC system, each of the three calls on the left requires
        its own separate round trip. Typically these would be chained, causing
        the sequence as a whole to require three sequential round trips. Even
        when making maximal use of available parallelism, the &quot;<tt>c(...)</tt>&quot;
        message could not be sent until both &quot;<tt>a()</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>b()</tt>&quot;
        had returned, resulting in a minimum delay of two sequential round trips.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the right hand side can stream out all three calls directly,
        without waiting for any round trips. To see why, lets visualize these
        messages using <a href="../concurrency/msg-passing.html#pipe-send">our
        standard Granovetter</a> notation: </p>
      <P ALIGN="center"><img src="../concurrency/images/pipe-example2.gif" width="528" height="453" alt="Pipelining Example">
      <p ALIGN="left">The key is that later messages can be sent specifying promises
        for the results of earlier messages as recipients or arguments, despite
        the fact that these promises are unresolved at the time these messages
        are sent. This allows VatL to stream out all three messages at the same
        time, possibly in the same packet. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Often the promise arguments in these messages still won't
        be resolved when their messages arrive, which is fine. However, often
        they will, especially in communications patterns that resemble client-server
        computing. For example, let's suppose VatL is a client-like vat, making
        use of a service offered by server-like vat VatR. First <tt>a()</tt> gets
        delivered to X, which, let's say, computes (finds or generates) a local
        object T1 as a result. Then <tt>b()</tt> gets delivered to Y, which, let's
        say, does the same, resulting in T2. Finally, when <tt>c(...)</tt> is
        arrives at VatR, t1 is already resolved to T1, so <tt>c(...)</tt> gets
        delivered to T1, with a t2 argument that's already resolved to the local
        object T2. </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Unfortunately, T1 cannot count on the argument being resolved
        by the time it receives <tt>c(...)</tt>, so this client-server pattern
        does not enable the code for T1 to be simpler. But it does often allow
        the typical case to be processed efficiently.</p>
      <h1 ALIGN="left">Abstraction <i>vs</i> Efficiency: Mobile Almost-Code</h1>
      <p ALIGN="left">For the sake of modularily, we seek to carve up our systems
        at good abstraction boundaries. For security, we wish to make divisions
        at trust and administration boundaries. For partition-survival, we divide
        to enable continued meaningful (if degraded) operation of the separated
        components. Fortunately, these three should correlate, and do in practice.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">But we'd also like to spread our distributed computations
        across separate machines according to the performance consequences. The
        key performance issue is often latency. And as hardware improves, latency
        will clearly dominate as the limiting factor. At the endpoints, processing
        will be ever cheaper and buffers larger, with the limits still many orders
        of magnitude away. At the pipes between these endpoints, bandwidth will
        likewise increase by many orders of magnitude, but latency will remain
        limited by the speed of light. Pipes between fixed endpoints can be made
        wider but not shorter.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">In a conventional RPC-based client-server system, if the
        &quot;<tt>t3 := (x.a()).c(y.b())</tt>&quot; were sufficiently common,
        the temptation would be to add a method for this pattern to the server,
        in order to save the round trip. The client could simply call this &quot;higher
        level&quot; method. However, this is often at odds with modularity goals.
        &quot;Higher-level&quot; often means more specialized, or <i>policy</i>
        rather than <i>mechanism</i>. Good modular systems of abstractions should
        normally export orthogonal composable primitives which are useful only
        when composed, but leave it to their clients to determine which composition
        to use. But this causes the client to compose several invocations to do
        any one useful thing.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">When this tension gets severe, the only real way to resolve
        it is with real mobile code. The client sends code to the server, such
        that on arrival the code can locally invoke the orthogonal composable
        primitives exported by the server. <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>
        is designed to support such real mobile code well and securely. But with
        promise pipelining, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s normal
        remote invocation can be seen as a lightweight special case of mobile
        code. The sending side, by making these invocations on remote references,
        causes the CapTP implementation to encode and send the moral equivalent
        of an expression involving <i>functional composition</i> (the use of function
        calls as arguments in other function calls). The receiving side, in decoding
        and processing these messages is effectively acting as an interpreter
        for the language these expressions are encoded in.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">An important future direction is to reconcile these two
        forms of mobile code into one uniform mobile code support mechanism.</p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/index.html">Udanax Gold</a>
        and <a href="http://www.sunless-sea.net/wiki/FrontPage">Purple</a> has
        a similar system (dating from the 1991, 1992 time frame), but only for
        assymetric (ie, client server) two-party communication. However, none
        of this technology was released until 1999, and was never explained in
        a published document.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Both &quot;<a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-624.pdf">A
        Safe, Efficient Object Database Interface Using Batched Futures</a>&quot;

        Cross-Domain Call Batching using Promises and Batched Control Structures</a>&quot;
        by Quinton Y. Zondervan, 1995, have strong similarities to the Udanax
        pipelining work, though discovered independently. (Both were theses done
        with Barbara Liskov as their thesis advisor.)</p>

        from ACM</a> with subscription) </p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The Udanax promise architecture influenced the way <a href="../../history/joule/index.html">Joule</a>'s
        network protocol, Indra, implemented distributed Joule Channels. CapTP's
        pipelining descends directly from this work, although the abstraction
        it pipelines is more similar to the Udanax Promise than the Joule Channel.
        Unfortunately, there is no publicly available description of Indra (yet?).</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">And of course, if you buy the analogy, the rich CPU architecture
        literature on instruction pipelining with register renaming is all possibly
        relevant. And since inter-machine pipes are much deeper than instruction
        pipes, we potentially have a lot more to gain from (approximately) their
        techniques than they do.</p>
