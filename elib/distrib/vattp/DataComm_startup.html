      <p>The Connection Startup Protocol uses messages formatted with java.io.DataOutputStream. 
        The first byte of the message is one of the types defined in org.erights.e.net.data.Msg. 
        PROTOCOL_VERSION, PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED, and STARTUP are used in the startup 
        protocol. The startup protocol uses writeUTF(), writeShort()&nbsp;(read 
        with readUnsignedShort()), and write(byte[]) in sending the pieces of 
        the protocol. These are refered to as UTF, short, and byte[] in the descriptions 
        below.</p>
      <p>The PROTOCOL_VERSION message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_VERSION=1, UTF 1stProtocolID, 
        UTF 2ndProtocolID, ...). The only protocol version currently supported 
        is "E1".</p>
      <p>The PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED message: (byte type=PROTOCOL_ACCEPTED=3, UTF protocolID).</p>
      <p>The STARTUP message is used for all the rest of the messages: (byte type=STARTUP=2,

      <p><b><font size=+1>Connection Establishment</font></b></p>
      <p>There are three layers of code responsible for connections in the data 
        comm system. The top level is VatTPMgr. It is responsible for all the 
        connections between a E vat and other vats. It includes methods such as 
        "VatTPConnection getConnection(remoteVatID , searchPath)" and "connectToVatAt(IP:port)" 
        which either create a connection and returns it, or return an existing 
        connection.</p>
      <p>The connection to a specific other vat is handled by the VatTPConnection 
        object. It is responsible for building new connections and resuming suspended 
        connections.</p>
      <p>The connection to a specific machine is handled by the DataPath object. 
        It, along with its SendThread and RecvThread, handles one TCP connection.</p>
      <p>The normal connection build process starts with the connection call to 
        the VatTPMgr described above. The remoteVatID parameter specifies which 
        specific vat is wanted, and the searchPath parameter specifies places 
        to look for it. The search path is normally a set of Process Location 
        Servers to query. There is a specific VatID ("0") which is recognized 
        as "any vat listening at the IP:port passed in the connectToVatAt() call 
        on the VatTPMgr.</p>
      <p>The search for a vat starts by building a DataPath to the first address 
        on the search path, normally a PLS. If that PLS knows where the vat is, 
        it returns the IP address and port number which is inserted into the search 
        path. The currently active instance of DataPath has then completed its 
        job, so it closes the TCP connection, and notifies the VatTPConnection 
        that it has shutdown. The VatTPConnection then builds a new DataPath to 
        try the next address in the search path.</p>
      <p>The connection startup protocol (Alice is connecting to Bob) used by 
        the DataPath is as follows. Note that there are two interleaved protocol 
        negotiations involved. The version of the E protocol to use, and the low 
        level encryption/compression protocol. The E protocol negotiation is over 
        quickly, while the encryption protocol negotiation involves the exchange 
        of keys and the verification of identities.</p>
      <p>In the description below, &lt;PROBLEM&gt; is one of ERR_PROTOCOL, if 
        a wrong protocol message type was received or the remote end is using 
        an unsupported version of the protocol, or ERR_WRONG_ID if the far end 
        responds IAM for the wrong vatID or the remote public key does not hash 
        to the vatID. TOK_ERR_INTERNAL is used to notify the other end that an 
        internal error has caused the connection attempt to fail.</p>
      <p>The protocol is described using the notation, "Sender: message paremeters 
        (comments)"</p>

      <p>If Alice receives TRY, as she would from the PLS, she adds the &lt;possibleAlternatePath&gt; 
        to her search path and shuts down the DataPath. If she receives NOTME 
        (NotMe) she just shuts down the DataPath without adding to the path. The 
        VatTPConnection will build a new DataPath to try the next entry in the

      <p>If Bob receives Alice's GIVEINFO and Bob knows of crossed connections 
        and Alice is the catbird:</p>
      <pre>   Bob: REPLYINFO &lt;UTF cryptoProtocols&gt;              (continue)
    or  YOUCHOSE  &lt;UTF&nbsp;cryptoProtocols&gt;              (continue)</pre>
      <p>Where &lt;cryptoProtocols&gt; is a comma separated list of crypto protocol 
        versions that Bob knows (see &lt;version&gt; below), in order from most

      <br>
      <b><font size=+1>Crossed connection notes<br>
      <br>
      </font></b>A crossed connection exists when Alice tries to build a connection 
      to Bob at the same time Bob is trying to build a connection to Alice. If 
      Bob's vatID is greater than Alice's, then Bob is the "catbird" and must 
      decide which of the two connections to use. Otherwise Alice is the catbird 
      and she must be notified that she is to decide. 
      <p></p>
      <p>Since the GIVEINFO state is on an incoming connection, Bob is in a position 
        to notice that he is also in the process of building a connection to Alice, 
        and the potential for crossed connections exists. If he is not the catbird 
        he notifies Alice that she must decide by sending the YOUCHOSE message.<br>
        <br>
        If he is the catbird, he looks at the state of the outgoing connection. 
        He decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection based on that 
        state:</p>
      <pre>    ST_UNSTARTED                      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_IAM            Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_REPLYINFO      Keep incoming
    ST_OUTGOING_EXPECT_GOTOO          Keep outgoing
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep outgoing</pre>
      <p>If Alice receives the YOUCHOSE message on her outgoing connection attempt, 
        she looks at the state of any incoming connection for Bob's vatID she 
        may know about. She decides to keep the incoming or the outgoing connection 
        based on that state:</p>
      <pre>    No connection known               Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_IWANT          Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GIVEINFO       Keep outgoing
    ST_INCOMING_EXPECT_GO             Keep incoming
    ST_EXPECT_MESSAGE                 Keep incoming</pre>
      <p>When Bob eliminates the outgoing connection or Alice eliminates the incoming 
        connection, they shutdown the path they are terminating. This action causes 
        the TCP connection to be closed and the DataPath to be shutdown.<br>
      <hr width="100%">
      <p></p>
      <pre>----------------Outgoing Expect REPLYINFO State------------------

      <p>If Alice received an invalid message type:</p>
      <pre> Alice: &lt;PROBLEM&gt;                                    (stop)</pre>
      <p>If Alice receives a DUP she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection. 
        If she receives one of the &lt;PROBLEM&gt; responses, she generates an 
        error log and stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</p>
      <p>If Alice receives a YOUCHOSE, she choses which connection to eliminate.</p>
      <pre> Alice: QUIT                          (If she keeps the incoming)</pre>
      <p>Otherwise she processes the YOUCHOSE the same as a REPLYINFO.</p>

      <p>If Alice receives a BYE, she stops attempting to connect on the MsgConnection.</p>
      <p>If Alice receives Bob's GOTOO, she starts an encrypted session or unencrypted

      <pre> &lt;crypto parameters&gt; are:
      &lt;UTF version&gt; &lt;version specific parameters&gt;

 The value of &lt;version&gt; is selected from the currently supported list:
      "None"      - No crypto used. No version specific parameters.
      "3DES_SDH_M" - Triple DES with DH key agreement and MAC.  &lt;DHparameters&gt;
                    are the version specific parameters.
                    More than one E message may be included a an

      "3DES_SDH_M2" - Triple DES/CBC with DH key agreement and HMAC. &lt;DHparameters&gt;

      <p>N.B. The signature covers the startup protocol in addition to just g<sup>x</sup> 
        mod m. This is to guard against an attack where a man in the middle can 
        change the list of supported encryption types and force no encryption 
        when both ends would prefer encrypted links. The specific messages included

        Several of these messages may be combined into a single TCP level message 
        for transmission over the TCP connection. This second kind of message 
        will be called a TCP message.</p>
      <p>These TCP&nbsp;messages are described using a notation which gives the 
        length of each element and its value. For example, a 4 byte integer length 
        is described as <tt>(4,length)</tt>. The fields are written one after 
        another to indicate concatination. For example: <tt>(4,length) (length,data)</tt>.</p>

        <p><b>Key generation</b></p>
        <p>This encryption version calculated 4 separate "keys". They are: a 24 
          byte 3DES key, a 64 byte MAC key, an 8 byte initial sendIV, and an 8 
          byte initial receiveIV. First a Diffie-Hellman secret (<tt>dhSecret</tt>) 
          is calculated by taking the <tt>g<sup>x</sup> mod m</tt> value received 
          from the other side and calculating <tt>BigInteger secret = (g<sup>x</sup> 
          mod m)<sup>y</sup> mod m </tt>using the standard Java BigInteger class. 
          Then <tt>byte[] dhSecret = secret.toByteArray();</tt> </p>
        <p>The individual keys are calculated from <tt>dhSecret </tt>using MD5 
          and a 16 byte pad consisting of a single byte repeated 16 times as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <p><tt>3DESKey1</tt> is the first 8 bytes of <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> 
            with <tt>0x55</tt> for the pad.<br>
            <tt>3DESKey2</tt> is the second 8 bytes of <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> 
            with <tt>0x55</tt> for the pad.<br>
            <tt>3DESKey3</tt> is the first 8 bytes of <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> 
            with <tt>0xaa</tt> for the pad.</p>
          <p><tt>MACKey</tt> is <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> with <tt>0x11</tt> 
            for the pad followed by <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> with <tt>0x22</tt> 
            for the pad followed by <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> with <tt>0x33</tt> 
            for the pad followed by <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> with <tt>0x44</tt> 
            for the pad.</p>
          <p>The <tt>sendIV </tt>and <tt>receiveIV </tt>are calculated by <tt>md5((16,pad)(n,dhSecret))</tt> 
            with <tt>0x99</tt> for the pad. If the connection is an outgoing connection, 
            the <tt>sendIV </tt>is the first 8 bytes and the <tt>receiveIV </tt>is 
            the second 8 bytes. If the connection is an incoming connection, the 
            <tt>sendIV </tt>is the second 8 bytes and the <tt>receiveIV </tt>is 
            the first 8 bytes.</p>

        <p><tt>(n,totalLength) (20,SHA1_MAC) (n,msgLength1) (msgLength1,message) 
          ... (n,pad)</tt></p>
        <p>The totalLength and msgLength fields are sent in compressed format. 
          For values between 0 and 127 (<tt>2<sup>7</sup>-1</tt>), the value is 
          sent as one byte (with one high zero bit). For values between 128 and 
          16,383 (<tt>2<sup>14</sup>-1</tt>), the value is sent as 2 bytes (with 
          two high zero bits). For values between 16,384 and 2,097,151 (<tt>2<sup>21</sup>-1</tt>), 
          the value is sent as 3 bytes (with three high zero bits). Since the 
          maximum size message is 1,048,576 (<tt>2<sup>20</sup></tt>), this encoding 
          covers all the legal messages.</p>
        <p>The totalLength field is the length in bytes of the all the messages 
          including their compressed length field. It does not include the 20 
          byte Message Authentication Code (MAC), the pad, or the length of the 
          totalLength field.</p>
        <p>The MAC is calculated using SHA1 and the authentication key generated 
          as part of key generation. The MAC is the result of: <tt>SHA1( (64,MACKey</tt> 
          <tt>) (n,msgLength1) (msgLength1,message) ... (64,MACKey</tt> <tt>) 
          )</tt>.</p>
        <p>After the TCP message is generated as above, it is encrypted using 
          Triple DES EDE in Cypher Block Chaining mode. (See <i>Applied Cryptography 
          </i>by Bruce Schneier for details.) The first Initialization Vector 
          (IV) is calculated as part of key generation. The next TCP message uses 
          an IV which is one higher than the previous one. The IV is considered 
          to be an 8 byte unsigned integer in big endian format for this addition.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><b>For encryption <tt>version == "3DES_SDH_M2"</tt></b></p>
      <ul>
        <p>Note that this protocol is the same as "3DES_SDH_M", except that a 
          the MAC is HMAC, the message number is sent separately, and the last 
          block of the previous message is used as the CBC IV for the next message.

        <p>The totalLength and msgLength fields are sent in compressed format. 
          For values between 0 and 127 (<tt>2<sup>7</sup>-1</tt>), the value is

        <p>The HMAC is calculated using SHA1 and the authentication key generated 
          as part of key generation. The HMAC is the result of: <tt>SHA1( ((64,MACKey)

          is the byte 0x5c repeated 64 times.</p>
        <p>The msgNumber field is zero for the first message and is incremented 
          by one for each following message. The msgNumber is considered to be 
          an 4 byte unsigned integer in big endian format for this addition. Note 
          that the sequence number starts over at zero after a suspended connection 
          is resumed.</p>
        <p>After the TCP message is generated as above, it is encrypted using 
          Triple DES EDE in Cypher Block Chaining mode. (See <i>Applied Cryptography

          (IV) is calculated as part of key generation. The next TCP message uses
