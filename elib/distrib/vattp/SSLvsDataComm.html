      <p><b><font size=+1>The E Comm system</font></b></p>
      <p>The E Comm system currently supports one cypher suite. It is most similar 
        to SSL's ID_SSL_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, which uses Diffie Hellman 
        (DH) key agreement to provide perfect forward security, the Digital Signature 
        Standard (DSS) to authenticate the connection, triple Data Encryption 
        Standard encryption operating in CBC mode (3DES_EDE_CBC) for data privacy, 
        and SHA for data authentication.</p>
      <p>Most of the cypher suites in SSL do not provide perfect forward security. 
        This valuable property causes the session key which protects a communication 
        session to be discarded after the connection is closed. The user can not 
        be coerced into revealing it because all forms, encrypted or not, have 
        been discarded. The ID_SSL_DH_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA suite has this 
        property, but most SSL implementations do not support it. (It does not 
        appear that the <a href="http://www.baltimore.ie/jssl/index.html">Baltimore</a> 
        or <a href="http://www.phaos.com/">Phaos</a> commercial Java implementations 
        support this mode yet. See <a href="#Commercial Java SSL">Commercial Java 
        SSL packages</a>.)</p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>Issues:</font></b></p>
      <p>X.509 vs. Key Centric Identity</p>
      <ul>
        <p>SSL supports the heiarchial X.509 view of identity. In this view, every 
          identity has a globally unique name, the &quot;Distinguished Name&quot;, 
          and there exists a heiarchy of Certificate Authorities (CAs) which bind 
          those names to the public/private key pairs used for authentication.</p>
        <p>The E Comm system uses a very different model of identity. In this 
          model you are identified by your public key. You are authenticated by 
          demonstrating that you know the private key associated with that public 
          key. There are no certificate authorities or certificates.</p>
        <p>To use SSL, we would have to package our keys as certificates. The 
          Baltimore support would allow us to override the acceptCertificate method 
          of SSL&lt;client/server&gt;Support to examine the key presented and 
          accept it. However, this override would not be compatible with the SSL 
          specification.</p>
        <p>Another hack which is probably &quot;legal&quot; SSL is as follows: 
          Our application is set up to accept a key pair &quot;cert&quot; as the 
          top level CA. We distribute both the public and private keys to that 
          CA as part of the application. When a vat goes to create an identity, 
          it creates a certificate which associates the RegistrarID (the hash 
          of the public key) as the X.509 destinguished name with the new public 
          key for the identity. When it builds a SSL connection, it passes that 
          certificate to the other end. We will need to add certificate checking 
          that ensures that the distinguished name is indeed the hash of the public 
          key, but I suspect all implementations will have an exit for that kind 
          of checking. (The Baltimore implementation does.)</p>
      </ul>
      <p>RSA vs. DSS.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>SSL was developed when RSA was the only digital signature scheme with 
          any degree of acceptance. Since then, DSS has received a degree of acceptance. 
          RSA is a patented algorthm, with &quot;mad dog&quot; patent lawyers 
          defending it. DSS is available for use without patent problems. That 
          is why we use DSS in the E comm system. My understanding from talking 
          with Tim Oren is that RSA licenses are only available on a &quot;unit 
          sold&quot; basis, and are not available for generating certificates 
          (so Verisign can maintain its monolopy).</p>
      </ul>
      <p>Client Server vs. Peer to Peer</p>
      <ul>
        <p>SLL is designed for Client/Server communications. The E Comm system 
          is designed for peer to peer communications. In the SSL model, the client 
          always builds connections to the server. In our model, either end can 
          build the connection, and we have to handle the case where both decide 
          to do it at about the same time. SSL has no such support. If we try 
          to use it for our style of communications, we would have to deal with 
          this problem.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>Support for PLS.</p>
      <ul>
        <p>A SSL client always knows where to contact his server. It is port 443 
          on host foo.bar.com. The domain name foo.bar.com allows runtime lookup 
          of the IP address for the server. There is no way to dynamically look 
          up the port number.</p>
        <p>The E comm system supports a way of dynamically finding not only the 
          IP address, but also the port number on which the other E system is 
          listening. This is the Process Location Server (PLS), a service which 
          is not available with SSL.</p>
        <p>The advantage of dynamically looking up the port number is that an 
          instance of the E comm system can be installed without need for administrative 
          intervention. It also allows more than one E comm system to run on a 
          single computer.</p>
        <p>The principle disadvantage is that it makes it harder to punch a hole 
          through a firewall for E communications.</p>
        <p>If we were to go to a fixed port number, we would need to get a assigned 
          port number from the Internet Assigned Name Authority. We would still 
          need some kind of PLS like lookup service for users who are dynamically 
          assigned IP addresses and domain names by their ISPs. (The PLS currently 
          has a fixed port assignment.)</p>
      </ul>
      <p><a name="Commercial Java SSL"></a><b><font size=+1>Commercial Java SSL 
        implementation</font></b></p>
      <p>There is a Java SSL implementation available from <a href="http://www.phaos.com/">Phaos 
        Technology</a> in New York. Their API is available with their evaluation 
        package.</p>
      <p>The Cryptix group is working on a Java SSL package. They have not released 
        anything yet.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.baltimore.ie/jssl/index.html">Baltimore Technologies 
        SSL</a> is an example of a commercial Java SSL package. It defines two 
        major classes: SSLServerSocket and SSLSocket, for servers and clients 
        respectivly.</p>
      <p><b><font size=+1>SSLServerSocket </font></b>(Client sockets are quite 
        similar)</p>
      <p>The constructors take a port number, maximum number of unaccepted connections, 
        and a SSLSupportFactory which defines the SLL&nbsp;support.</p>
      <p>There are two methods: accept and toString. accept returns s newly-created, 
        non-authenticated SSLSocket connection to a remote host. Calling any of 
        the accessors on the returned socket, such as getInputStream() or getOutputStream() 
        will initiate the authentication handshake.</p>
      <p>The SSLSupportFactory provided determines all the SSL parameters. They 
        provide an implementation which only supports RSA for authentication</p>
