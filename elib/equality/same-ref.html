      <p>For any references <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, &quot;<tt>x == y</tt>&quot; 
        immediately (synchronously) either returns true, returns false, or throws 
        an Exception. If x and y are both Settled, then == must return either 
        true or false. Therefore, if it throws an Exception, then at least one 
        of the two operands was Unsettled at the time. If the sameness formulas 
        of x and y are the same, then x == y returns true and we say they are 
        are <i>designationally equivalent</i>. If x and y are both settled (ie, 
        their sameness formulas are ground, ie, they contain no unbound variables, 
        ie, their sameness identity does not depend on any promises), then if 
        their sameness formulas are the same, then they designate the <i>same</i> 
        object. If the sameness formulas of two settled references are different, 
        then they designate different objects, and <tt>x == y</tt> returns false.</p>
      <p>The == predicate is <i>monotonic</i>, meaning that once it returns an 
        answer for a pair of operands (rather than throwing an Exception), it 
        will always return that same answer for the same pair of operands. Unsettled 
        references don't normally provide enough information to determine what 
        the answer will be when they're Settled, which is why == needs the option 
        of not answering when the operands are Unsettled. As you might expect 
        by these properties, and as you can see in the state transition diagram 
        below, a reference can transition from being Unsettled to Settled, but 
        once Settled always Settled.</p>
      <p>E's built-in hashtable-based collection abstraction, <a href="../../elang/collect/tables.html">EMap</a>, 
        requires Settled keys. If an attempt is made to use an Unsettled reference 
        as a key, they will throw an Exception rather than accept the key. </p>
      <p></p>
      <h1>When are two references the same?</h1>
      <p>As with the <a href="../concurrency/refmech.html#legend">Expanded Reference 
        Taxonomy</a> on the Reference Mechanics page, the following diagram also 
        illustrates the possible transitions between the states of a Live reference, 
        but now organized for purposes of reasoning about distributed reference 
        sameness. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/ref-settling.gif" width="515" height="874"></p>
      <h2>Promises as Logic Variables</h2>
      <p>*** explain</p>
      <h2>PowerKeys</h2>
      <p>*** explain</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">******* Just stale notes below this line. Please 
        ignore *******</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Currently, a == implementation is allowed (but not required) to answer 
        true or false when either or both x and y are Unsettled, provided it is 
        able to prove that they can't settle in such a way as to cause == to provide 
        a different answer at a later time, which would violate monotonicity. 
        Although it would be expensive, at some point we will probably tighten 
        the spec (and the reference implementation) to require == to throw an 
        Exception unless both operands are Settled, just as hashtable do with 
        their keys. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Wraps a possibly unsettled base reference, in order to be able 
        to use it as key in an EMap. 
      <p> This is called a <i>PowerKey</i> because it has a relationship to the 
        base reference-as-key much like the relationship of a powerset to a base 
        set. 
      <p> In E, by definition, any settled reference designates a particular settled 
        object. Also by definition, a settled object, whether Selfish or Selfless, 
        has a particular sameness identity. Given two settled references, <tt>x</tt> 
        and <tt>y</tt> 
      <pre>    x == y</pre>
      returns true or false according to whether x and y designate objects with 
      the same sameness identity. Once a reference is settled, it is always settled 
      to the same sameness identity, so answers to the above question are <i>stable</i> 
      -- the same question asked at a later time will give the same answer. EMaps 
      (hashtables) require such stability of their keys, and therefore only accept 
      settled references as their keys. 
      <p> Were all references <i>Near</i>, <i>Far</i>, or <i>Disconnected</i>, 
        there would only be settled references and settled objects. The other 
        cases occur because of the other kinds of references, and because of their 
        interaction with <i>Selfless</i> objects. The remaining kinds of references 
        are <i>Promises</i> (or <i>Unresolved</i> references) and <i>Unconnected</i> 
        references. 
      <ul>
        <li>A <b>Near</b> reference is the only kind that appears in convention 
          object languages like Smalltalk or Java: it designates a particular 
          object in the same address space and conveys the authorty to call that 
          object. In E terms, all referenes in these conventional languages are 
          indeed settled. 
        <li>A <b>Far</b> reference is a resolved remote reference to a PassByProxy 
          object. PassByProxy objects are necessarily Selfish, and Selfish objects 
          are necessarily settled (see below). Therefore, Far references are settled. 
        <li>A <b>Disconnected</b> reference is a former Far reference after it's 
          been broken by partition. To preserve stability of <tt>==</tt> and EMap 
          keys, a Disconnected reference still has the sameness identity it had 
          as a Far reference, and thereby must still be said to <i>designate</i> 
          its target object, even though it no longer conveys authority to invoke 
          that object. (Due to this behavior of Disconnected references, we say 
          that <tt>==</tt> tests <i>designational equivalence</i> rather than 
          computational equivalence.) 
        <li>Each <b>Selfish</b> object is endowed with a primitive unreified sameness 
          identity by the act of creation. Two Selfish objects that are otherwise 
          identical but were created by two separate acts of creation are not 
          the <i>same</i>. By virtue of this primitive identity, Selfish objects 
          are born settled. (In conventional object languages, all heap allocated 
          objects are Selfless, with their identity really being their memory 
          address.) 
        <li>In E, all objects are either Selfish or <b>Selfless</b>. Selfless 
          objects have no creation identity. As in conventional object languages, 
          the scalars (null, booleans, ints, float64s, chars) are atomically Selfish. 
          Besides these, the identity of a Selfess object is based only on a recursive 
          (cycle tolertant) sameness comparison of their components. The sameness 
          identity of a Selfless object can be considered a formula (or a Herbrand 
          term) expressed in terms of the sameness identity of these components. 
        <li>In terms of sameness formulas, each <b>Promise</b> (unresolved reference) 
          is a logic variable. When a promise is resolved, even if to another 
          promise, all occurrences of that promise are (as if) replaced by what 
          the promise resolves to. A reference is settled or not exactly according 
          to whether its sameness formula still contains any unresolved promises, 
          ie, unbound logic variables. 
        <li>An <b>Unconnected</b> reference corresponds to a logic variable we 
          know will never be resolved further. XXX We need to decide on the precise 
          sameness semantics of these. 
      </ul>
      In terms of sameness formulas, <tt>x == y</tt> is true when they are the 
      same formulas. It is false when the two formulas are such that no possible 
      substitution of values for their respective variables could make them the 
      same (when the formulas could not be unified). When the formulas are not 
      currently the same but may or may not become the same based on future substitutions, 
      then <tt>x == y</tt> throws. 
      <p> * * * * (XXX I suspect the following paragraph is stale, and that PowerKey 
        now has better properties, like more stable sameess, as documented after 
        this paragraph.) Used to finitely and successfully walk possibly cyclic 
        & unsettled structures. A PowerKey wrapper always claims to be settled, 
        though a cbx == cby that returns false now can return true later. Nevertheless, 
        one can safely use CycleBreakers as keys in the built in hashtables (EMap, 
        etc), since the hashCode they report to the map is stable. 
      <p> This object itself has stable sameness, which is why it may be used 
        as a key in an EMap. It's sameness is no worse that a snapshot of the 
        sameness-possibility-set of the value it wraps, where this snapshot is 
        made when the PowerKey is constructed. Its sameness is no better than 
        that of the object it wraps. For example, after the sequence
      <pre>
    def cb1 := makeCycleBreaker(p)
    # ...
    def cb2 := makeCycleBreaker(p)
</pre>
      cb1 will always be == to cb1, and cb2 will always be == cb2. If p did not 
      settle further during the "# ...", the cb1 will be == cb2. If it did settle 
      some, then they may or may not be ==. 
      <p> If p3 != p4, then makeCycleBreaker(p3) != makeCycleBreaker(p4) </p>
