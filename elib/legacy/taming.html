      <p ALIGN="left"><i>(We recommend reading <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-review/security-review.html#taming">Taming
        the Java Interface</a> first.)</i></p>
      <hr>
      <P ALIGN="left">Despite Norm's insightful caution, taming is about the construction
        of retroactive theories. Taming works when the retroactive theories are
        sound <i>enough</i>. A proper theory of taming requires us to identify
        when we should and should not expect to be able to create sound retroactive
        theories.
      <P ALIGN="left">Work on taming to date has been on taming the Java API in 
        order to obtain, in effect, a capability-oriented class library for <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>. 
        (Though the same principle should apply for other libraries.) Other approaches 
        to creating such a library are 1) creating one from scratch, or 2) wrapping 
        the Java API in a wholly new API. While both of these approaches are likely 
        safer than taming, they are also a lot more work -- in the case of user 
        interface toolkits, unaffordably more work. The capability-approach to 
        API design is the theory being retroactively imposed, and the Java APIs 
        are the system they are being imposed on -- a system not designed according 
        to capability principles. 
      <P ALIGN="left">We expected to largely succeed at taming Java APIs, and
        we largely have succeeded; modulo the many problems pointed out by the
        <a href="http://www.combex.com/papers/darpa-review/security-review.html#taming">Taming
        the Java Interface</a> section of the Darpa Security Review. Why was much
        success possible in this area? Because well-done, highly modular object
        design already often resembles good capability design. Where the Java
        APIs were better by normal oo design principles, they were generally easy
        to tame. Where they weren't, it was often a mistake to try to tame them.
        On our next pass over the Java API, we will either wrap (KeyMap) or reimplement
        (HTML Widget) these, rather than trying to tame them.
      <P ALIGN="left">There are two kinds of properties that a well designed capability-oriented
        API written in a capability language would have -- <i>imposed properties</i>
        and <i>designed properties</i>. Taming should result in an API exhibiting
        the equivalent of both of these properties.
      <h1 ALIGN="left">Imposed Properties</h1>
      <p ALIGN="left">Were the system to be tamed instead written in a capability
        language, each object would have a certain measure of capability discipline
        imposed on it, independent of its internal workings. Specifically, it
        would have some limited set of capabilities it could wield, which determine
        the limits on the authorities it can exercise. Our first retroactive theory
        component is to assign to each object a theory of what capabilities it
        is assumed to be able to hold. When the tamer (the human making taming
        decisions) has access to the implementation, the object's instance variables
        (as tamed according to their imposed and designed properties, see below)
        are often a good initial draft of this theory, to be refined according
        to other considerations.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Once such a fictional assignment of authority to an object 
        is made, the first and simplest taming decision is to simply disallow 
        any methods on its interface that could cause it to exceed its theorized 
        authorities. For example, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i> 
        disallows <tt><a href="../../javadoc/java/lang/Boolean.html#getBoolean(java.lang.String)">Boolean.getBoolean(String)</a></tt> 
        because this can only be implemented by access to the System properties, 
        and such access exceeds the authorities presumed to be held by the tamed 
        <tt>&lt;import:java.lang.Boolean&gt;</tt>.</p>
      <h1 ALIGN="left">Designed Properties</h1>
      <p ALIGN="left">Each object reference to a tamed object is a capability.
        As a capability, it provides its client (an object holding it) some authority
        -- the ability to effect or be effected by the world outside of oneself
        that the client doesn't otherwise necessarily have. Our second retroactive
        theory component is to say, for each object type, what authority it provides.
        This must be a simple and intuitive statement that programmers can think
        in terms of when using a capability to such an object, and especially
        when deciding to hand this capability to something else. This statement
        should also not exceed in authority what a programmer would naturally
        guess without reading the documentation, though it can be a subset of
        the natural guess.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Once such a fictional theory of the authority provided by
        a kind of object is determined, then all methods which would allow a client
        to exceed this fiction must be diallowed.</p>
      <h3 ALIGN="left">The File Example</h3>
      <p ALIGN="left">The taming of <tt><a href="../../javadoc/java/io/File.html">java.io.File</a></tt> 
        is the clearest example of why taming according to imposed properties 
        is insufficient. <tt>java.io.File</tt> objects represent files or directories 
        in the directory tree of a file system. If these <tt>File</tt> objects 
        were interpreted as capabilities, then it would be as if each designated 
        a place in the file system, but each gave access (by navigation) to the 
        whole file system. Since one can indeed build such a file system abstraction 
        in a pure capability system, an analysis purely in terms of imposed properties 
        will not fix the situation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">However, though the above design is possble in a capability
        system, it isn't a capability-oriented design. Just as the design of the
        file system itself provides for the division of storage into a named hierachy,
        a capability-oriented design should leverage this to provide a corresponding
        division of the right to access this storage. Starting from the existing
        Java API, we impose the retroactive theory that a <tt>java.io.File</tt>
        instance, if it represents a non-directory normal file, provides the authority
        to read and write this one file, but no further access to the file system.
        If it represents a directory, it gives authority to read and edit that
        directory, and any files and subdirectories transitively under that directory.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">This is a purely retroactive theory. It is not in any way
        related to any of the goals the designers of java.io.File had in mind.
        Nevertheless, we can succeed at it merely by preventing upward navigation.
        To do this, we need to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suppress <tt><a href="../../javadoc/java/io/File.html#getParentFile()">getParentFile()</a></tt> 
          (which we failed to do by the time of the review -- <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=75274&atid=551529&func=detail&aid=1238671">a 
          taming bug</a>)</li>
        <li>Suppress resolution of &quot;<tt>..</tt>&quot; in paths. This cannot
          be done by taming alone, since it involves altering the behavior of
          an existing method. This is an example of a technique intermediate between
          taming and wrapping -- virtualization. In our &quot;sugaring&quot;,
          the wrapping method that imposes this restriction presents the same
          API as the original. From the perspective of the client, its as if the
          original interface were changed to impose this restriction.</li>
        <li>Decide on our stance regarding hard and symbolic links. Our initial
          theory was phrased in terms of &quot;hierarchy&quot;, but these links
          require us to expand our theory somehow.</li>
      </ul>
