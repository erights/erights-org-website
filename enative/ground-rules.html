          <p><b><i><a name="noTypes"></a>No static type analysis of E source code</i></b>.
            The optional SlotMaker expression in an E variable declaration is
            intended, among other things, to allow the programmer to give a compiler
            static type information about the values that the variable may hold.
            A sophisticated compiler could make direct use of this, and indirect
            use as an aid to infer further types. With static type knowledge,
            a sophisticated compiler could generate better code than the simple
            compiler proposed by ENative.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><b><a name="simpleScoping"></a>Only simple scope analysis</b></i>.
            Crucial to the efficiency of E, even for a simple naive implementation
            such as ENative, is partitioning variables into one of <a href="varcases.html">several
            cases</a>, and implementing variable definition, access, assignment,
            and slot access differently according to which kind of variable we
            have.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a name="noVirtual"></a><i><b>No use of C++'s &quot;virtual&quot;</b></i>.
            &quot;<tt>virtual</tt>&quot; is C++'s mechanism for run-time polymorphism,
            and its notation hides some implementation cost. By avoiding it, we
            ensure that all run-time polymorphism is provided only by C's pointer-to-function
            mechanism, leaving all costs clear.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><b><a name="noTemplates"></a>No use of C++'s template feature</b></i>,
            except possibly for the various scalar Lists. The complexity isn't
            worth it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a name="fewRefs"></a><i><b>No unnecessary use of C++'s references</b></i>.
            By always using pointers instead, indirection costs are always explicit.
            <i>Note: if the C++ compilers of interest normally generate better
            code for references than pointers, which is quite possible, then this
            decision may be revisited.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><b><a name="absorbStack"></a>Absorb, rather than reify, <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s stack
            discipline</b></i>. Approximately following <a href="http://www.ageofsig.org/people/bcsmith/index.html">Brian
            Smith</a>'s usage, by &quot;absorb&quot; I mean that E calls turn
            into C++ calls, E (implicit) returns turn into C++ (explicit) returns,
            and E exception throwing &amp; catching turns into C++ exception throwing
            &amp; catching. In the other conventional language implementation
            option -- reifying stack discipline -- we would implement <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s implicit
            stack state in explicit C++ data structures. By absorbing, we also
            allow C++ native (primitive) code to be written in a style natural
            to the C++ programmer. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><b><a name="noStackDebug"></a>No portable virtual machine support
            for stack debugging</b></i>. This is one of the consequences of absorbing
            <i><b><font color="#009000">E</font></b></i>'s stack discipline into C++'s. In the resulting code, there is no
            data structure accessible to portable C++ code that explicitly represents
            the C++ stack, and therefore no data structure that explicitly represents
            the E stack. For a widely ported C++ compiler &amp; debugger combo
            such as gcc/gdb, it is conceivable one could provide &quot;portable&quot;
            debugging access to the E stack by wrapping gdb's provision of &quot;portable&quot;
            access to the C++ stack. I put &quot;portable&quot; in scare-quotes
            to emphasize that this would be portable across hardware platforms
            but not across C++ implementations. </p>
          <p>It is fine for this meta-level access to be much slower than normal
            computation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><i><a name="otherDebugging"></a>Portable meta-level access to
            board-state </i></b> in support of, for example, debugging and serialization
            control. E computation within a vat occurs as a sequence of atomic
            transactions called <i>turns</i>. Each turn consists of the synchronous
            processing to completion of a pending delivery from that vat's vat-queue.
            Stack state only occurs within a turn. The state of greater importance,
            for most meta-level purposes, is the state present in a vat between
            turns. If we think of a vat as a game board and a turn as a turn in
            a game, the states during a turn (including stack state) are transitional:
            &quot;The pawn is in my hand, because I've picked it up but haven't
            put it back down.&quot; We call the well-defined states between turns
            <i>board-states</i>. A turn always computes from one board-state to
            another. </p>
          <p> A board-state consists of the states of the objects within the vat,
            the state of the vat's pending delivery queue, the states of various
            primitive &quot;devices&quot;, and the state of a vat's comm system
            -- managing the references that cross between this vat and other vats.
            The E virtual machine will define portable means for accessing all
            of this board-state (as well as manipulating some of it). ENative
            must implement this spec using only portable C++ constructs, rather
            than, as above, relying on features provided by a particular C++ implementation.
            Fortunately, only object-state access is relevant to the subset of
            E currently represented by ENative.</p>
          <p>As above, it is fine for this meta-level access to be much slower
            than normal computation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><i><b><a name="assumeGC"></a>Assume a garbage collector</b></i>.
            There are <i>so</i> many ways to implement garbage collection, with
            <i>so</i> many performance tradeoffs, that ENative simply defers this
            issue for now and naively allocates (using C++'s &quot;new&quot;)
            without every freeing. Some conservative garbage collectors are happy
            to live underneath such C++ code and successfully garbage collect
            without further programmer (or compiler) attention. The overhead of
            a given garbage collection scheme can usually be approximated as a
            function of the number of objects allocated. Any benchmarks run on
            ENative would have to be adjusted by these estimates before they should
            be taken seriously.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a name="realCosts"></a>Except for garbage collection, <i><b>impose
            all costs that a complete implementation would impose</b></i>. ENative,
            being for now an academic exercise, is, and may remain, far from a
            complete implementation of Kernel-E. However, of the Kernel-E programs
            that it does run, it should be at least as expensive as a complete
            implementation of ENative would be. For example, the SmallInteger
            add code checks for overflow. If overflow occurs, it throws a &quot;<tt>BigInteger
            Not Yet Implemented</tt>&quot; exception rather than allocating
            one, but this imposes all the costs on the successful case that a
            complete implementation would impose. The resulting measured timing
            may be taken as a reliable lower bound on performance (or upper bound
            on expected running time) except for </p>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>the above garbage collection issue,</li>
            <li>a larger memory footprint (and therefore potentially a worse instruction-cache
              hit ratio),</li>
            <li>
              <p>longer startup times, due both to the larger footprint and to
                more static initialization. (But still expected to be trivial
                compared to Java's startup time.)</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a name="classObsolete"></a><i><b>Impose costs of upgrade-for-prototyping</b></i>.
            This is really a special case of the above, but is listed separately
            since it is the least obvious cost that would be imposed by a complete
            implementation. To support rapid prototyping, the E specification,
            like Smalltalk, supports the loading of replacement behavior for already
            instantiated objects, and the conversion of these old object states
            to become post-facto instances of the new behavior. Like at least
            ParcPlace Smalltalk, this is done lazily at the time the obsolete
            objects are invoked. Unlike Smalltalk, E has not yet implemented this
            feature. ENative does not either, but it does impose all the costs
            on normal execution needed to support this feature.</p>
          <p>Note that an upgrade (whether -for-prototyping or -for-release) only
            becomes effective between turns, so it need only worry about old object-states
            and old undelivered messages, but not old stack-frames. This is quite
            fortunate, as there is nothing obvious one can do with a stale stack-frame following an upgrade. (<i>A note to be put somewhere else: Under
            normal conditions, an upgrade-for-release also need not deal with
            old undelivered messages, since neither the vat-queue nor <a href="../elib/concurrency/refmech.html">Eventual
            references</a> are checkpointed.</i>)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b><i><a name="compile"></a>Compile rather than interpret</i></b>,
            but use runtime conventions that allow either. The ENative runtime,
            corresponding approximately to ELib, accomodates both E code compiled
            into C++ according to its conventions, as well as the interpretation,
            by a hypothetical byte-code interpreter, of E compiled to a hypothetical
            byte code language. Indeed, I first designed ENative with a byte code
            interpreter in mind before I switched to a compilation strategy. Compiling
            to C++ has the obvious advantage of speed. A disadvantage that often
            drives implementations towards interpreters is code-size blow up.
            But by taking an absorption strategy, we manage to avoid this problem.
            The remaining disadvantages of compilation are </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><a name="dynamicLoading"></a>Dynamic code loading becomes non-portable.
                This is much like the debugging issue above. A given widely-ported
                C++ system, such as gcc, may provide a platform portable way to
                dynamically load new code, but C++ code using this abstraction
                would be specific to this C++ system, while being hardware-platform
                independent. The E language spec requires dynamic code loading,
                so a complete implementation of ENative must deal with this issue.
                Were we to interpret byte-codes instead (or in addition), then
                this issue would go away.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><a name="dynamicUnloading"></a>Dynamic code unloading becomes
                similarly non-protable. This is called out separately because
                it would also interact with the assumed garbage collector.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a name="callSite"></a><i><b>Call-site cacheing</b></i>. Experience
            with dynamic object language implementations, especially Smalltalk,
            shows that if there's one &quot;sophisticated&quot; optimization that's
            worth doing, it's &quot;<a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/90-11-069">call-site
            cacheing</a>&quot; (originally known as an &quot;inline method cache&quot;,
            invented by Deutsch and Schiffman and presented at POPL 1984). For
            a given message call/send expression, if the dynamic implementation-type
            (script) of the object is the same as it was last time, <i>as it usually
            is</i>, then this call/send would look up the same method, so go there
            directly. ENative demonstrates that this optimization can be coded
            very simply. The flow of execution on a cache hit we call the <i>fast-path</i>.
            The execution on a cache miss is the <i>slow-path</i>. These caches
            must, of course, be invalidated by an <a href="#classObsolete">upgrade-for-prototyping</a>.</p>
