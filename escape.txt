Subject: escape

In E:

to foo(...) {
   ...
   escape bletch {
      ...body...
   }
   ...
}

In Smalltalk:

foo: ...
    ...
    escaper callCC: [:bletch |
        ...body...
    }
    ...


The generic escaper has a generic callCC method

callCC: escapeClause
    escapeClause value: [:result | ^result]
