      <h3>DRAFT</h3>
      Many programming languages reduce each module of program code to a set of 
      assembly language-level instructions (bytecodes or native assembler instructions). 
      When the time comes to load a given module, its instructions must be checked 
      to make sure they will not violate certain properties of the higher-level 
      language, such as memory boundaries. This paper presents a technique for 
      implementing such load-time checking, as exemplified by the Bouncer; component 
      of Joule.<br>
      <br>
      While Joule applies this bouncing technique to bytecodes, the mechanism 
      is as applicable to other software-implemented instruction sets and to native 
      machine instructions. The technique is equally appropriate for strongly 
      typed languages such as Ada, Pascal, Modula 3, C, and C++, and for latently 
      typed languages such as Smalltalk, Scheme, and Joule.<br>
      <br>
      The "bouncing" technique described here is not new, but is rather derived 
      straightforwardly from previous work, including:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>type state checking, by which a variable's value can be statically 
          determined as unreferenced and therefore deletable. </li>
        <li>abstract interpretation, in which properties of programs (deadlock 
          freedom, computational complexity, etc.) are computed by interpreting 
          instructions using only abstract properties of the actual data values. 
        </li>
        <li>a machine-code verifier created by L. Peter Deutsch for the 940 operating 
          system to verify security properties of instruction-level programs. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.1 About Modules</h3>
      In this paper, a "module" is the smallest unit of compiled code that can 
      be loaded into a runtime environment. In the Joule language, this unit of 
      code corresponds to the <b><tt>Module</tt></b> form. In Joule, a module 
      of code is reduced to bytecodes by the compiler.<br>
      <h3>1.2 The Bouncer as Load-Time Checker</h3>
      The Bouncer is a program that statically checks each module before it is 
      loaded, rejecting any module that does not pass specific static checks. 
      The name "Bouncer" is inspired by the doorman of a nightclub who keeps out 
      unsavory characters.<br>
      <h4>1.2.1 Bouncer Rules</h4>
      The Bouncer maintains internal state which changes as it processes each 
      instruction. First, it checks each instruction to make sure the preconditions 
      for that instruction have been established by prior instructions in the 
      module. Then it alters its state to reflect the mutating impact of the instruction, 
      and finally tests to make sure its own invariants are intact.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, for each type of instruction, a set of rules have been specified for 
      comparing the state of the abstract machine against known requirements. 
      The rules for checking the preconditions of an instruction are called its 
      "test" rules. The rules for checking the state-mutating impact of the instruction 
      are called its "mutate" rules. <br>
      <br>
      In this way, the Bouncer protects Joule's memory safety and security. A 
      module that fails to satisfy the rules is rejected, or "bounced." Acceptable 
      code is passed by the Bouncer to be interpreted or translated by other components 
      of the Joule abstract machine.<br>
      <br>
      The Bouncer does not attempt to prove the correctness of every possible 
      correct program, which is theoretically impossible. Rather, it proves a 
      verifiable subset of programs and rejects all others. In this respect, it 
      is similar to type checking in languages such as Pascal. No loss of expressive 
      power results from this constriction of possibilities, though the set of 
      alternative implementations of a given solution may be reduced.<br>
      <h4>1.2.2 Bouncer State</h4>
      The Bouncer state machine has a set of static registers. These exist at 
      bounce time, not at run time; they represent the state of what the Bouncer 
      knows about the actions of the program code before and after each instruction. 
      Some of the static Bouncer registers are:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>pc</b>--The current value of the Joule abstract machine's program 
          counter. </li>
        <li></li>
        <li><br>
          <b>numLocals</b>--The number of local variables allocated in the current 
          activation frame. </li>
        <li></li>
        <li><br>
          <b>writable[numLocals]</b>--An array of booleans indicating, for each 
          local variable, whether it is legal to assign it. </li>
        <li></li>
        <li><br>
          <b>types[numLocals]</b>--An array of static types, providing knowledge 
          about the runtime representation type ("uninitialized", "tagged pointer", 
          "facet pointer", etc.) of each local variable of the current Activation. 
          The actual local variables are in the array <b>locals[numLocals]</b>, 
          which exist only at run time, not at bounce time. </li>
      </ul>
      In these terms, the instruction<br>
      <br>
      OP_MOVE (3, 5)<br>
      <br>
      means to move the value in locals[5] into the position locals[3]. It is 
      subject to this set of rules:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Test</b> writable[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mutate</b> types[3] := types[5];<br>
      <br>
      This tests that local variable number three can be assigned to, and specifies 
      how to modify the typestate used to test the next instruction. All of the 
      array indexing is implicitly bounds checked, so if <b>numLocals</b> is less 
      than 6, this load attempt is also bounced.<br>
      <h4>1.2.3 Control-Flow Checking</h4>
      First, the Bouncer derives a model of the state of the abstract machine 
      before and after each instruction in the module being checked that is consistent 
      with all forks and joins called for by the instructions.<br>
      <h4>1.2.3.1 Forking</h4>
      A program fork results from the evaluation of some Boolean expression, which 
      may be true, false, or a pointer to some other value.<br>
      <br>
      The instruction that implements forking,<br>
      <br>
      OP_TEST_IF (cond, onFalse, onFail)<br>
      <br>
      falls through to the next instruction if <tt>locals[cond]</tt> is primitively 
      true, branches to <tt>onFalse</tt> if <tt>locals[cond]</tt> is primitively 
      false, and branches to <tt>onFail</tt> otherwise. In the Bouncer, this means 
      that we propagate the current Bouncer state to all three locations.<br>
      <h4>1.2.3.2 Joining</h4>
      Following a fork, it may be necessary to interpret the re-joining of the 
      two execution paths into a single consistent state. <br>
      <center>
        <p><img src="bouncer_files/bouncer2.gif" alt="Joining" align="bottom" height="162" width="181"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Figure 1: Joining -- <b>L</b> and <b>R </b>represent the two (possibly 
        inconsistent) prior states of the Bouncer; <b>J</b> represents the resulting 
        state.<br>
        <br>
        Treating this join as if it were an instruction, the Bouncer applies these 
        rules (where the subscripts <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> designate the static 
        values in each of the two prior states):<br>
      </p>
      <pre><b>Test</b>   numLocalsL== numLocalsR

<b>Mutate</b> for (i = 0; i &lt; numLocals; i++) {
                 if (writableL[i] == writableR[i]) {  
                       writableJ[i] := writableL[i];

                 } else {
                       writableJ[i] := FALSE;
                 }

                 if (typesL[i] == typesR[i]) {
                       typesJ[i] := typesL[i];
                 } else {
                       typesJ[i] := VOID;

                 } 
              }</pre>
      That is, if the two prior states agree on the type of a slot, the slot is 
      considered to be of that type in the state representation <b>J</b>; if not, 
      the slot is considered uninitialized, and cannot be read by code following 
      the join until it is assigned.<br>
      <h4>1.2.3.3 Looping</h4>
      If any loops occur in the module, the instructions within the loop again 
      need to be checked against the Bouncer state as it exists at the time of 
      the backward jump. If multiple possible states loop back to the same point, 
      they are treated as joins.<br>
      <br>
      The proliferation of states resulting from multiple forks and joins is controlled 
      because inconsistent slots collapse to "uninitialized" when joined. This 
      means that, on any iteration through the module, there will be strictly 
      fewer joins required than on the previous iteration, because any inconsistencies 
      previously encountered have collapsed the affected slots to "uninitialized".<br>
      <br>
      The Bouncer inevitably either rejects the program for being unsafe or converges 
      to a single consistent model describing the state of the Joule abstract 
      machine prior to each instruction in the module. This representation must 
      converge to a fixed-point state of the Bouncer because the collapse of inconsistent 
      slots to "uninitialized" is monotonic, and the number of slots is finite.<br>
      <h4>1.2.4 Representation Type Checking</h4>
      There are two Bouncer phases. After the Bouncer has derived a single consistent 
      state history of the Joule abstract machine based on the control-flow checking, 
      the Bouncer then passes through the instructions of the module and applies 
      the test and mutate rules to each, based on the state arrived at in the 
      control-flow check for each instruction. If any instruction generates an 
      unacceptable state of the Bouncer by failing to conform to the rules, the 
      module is rejected and an exception is signaled. <br>
      <h3>1.3 Summary</h3>
      The smallest unit of program code that can be loaded is called a module. 
      Each module consists of a set of assembly-level instructions, which may 
      be either bytecodes (as in Joule) or native instructions.<br>
      <br>
      When a module is loaded, its instructions must be checked to make sure they 
      will not violate certain properties of the higher-level language, such as 
      memory boundaries. This paper presented a technique for implementing such 
      load-time checking, using the Bouncer component of the Joule abstract machine 
      as an example.<br>
      <br>
      While Joule applies this bouncing technique to bytecodes, the mechanism 
      is equally applicable to native assembler instructions. The technique can 
      be extended to verify more sophisticated properties, such as statically 
      known reference counts, static array bounds checking, type structure for 
      objects in the heap, and real-time constraints.<br>
