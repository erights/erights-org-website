<h1>Extending Java for Secure, Distributed Applications</h1>

<P><BR clear=all>
E extends Sun's Java programming language with some powerful enhancements,
featuring distributed processing, enhanced security and a message-based
language structure that support the development of applications for collaboration
and commerce on the Internet. The strength of the E Extensions to Java
is in their ability to let you to write secure communications-oriented
applications easily and effectively. 
<HR><p></P>

<H2>Properties of E</H2>

<P>E's unique capabilities are derived from the following four categories
of communications-oriented properties: </P>

<H3>Distributed communication --</H3>

<P>provides a single messaging facility that allows an object to send a
message to another object, even if the other object is in a different machine
on the network. E lets you automatically establish connections between
objects without having to deal directly with the underlying network protocols.
</P>

<H3>Capability semantics --</H3>

<P>offers a security model based on the use of capabilities, which grant
permissions to objects to send particular messages to particular objects
in a distributed system. It is impossible for an object to send an unauthorized
message. Capability semantics provides a simple, effective, and dependable
tool for the construction of secure systems. </P>

<H3>Optimistic computation -- </H3>

<P>allows execution to advance without waiting, thereby providing better
use of parallel execution and load balancing. Through optimistic computation,
problems of deadlock and race conditions are avoided. </P>

<H3>Trust management --</H3>

<P>provides a framework for cryptographic verification of the authorship
and integrity of E classes and packages. In a networked world, users will
want to download and run software from disparate sources on their machines.
E provides a Trust Manager to verify the originator of a class or package
and can verify that the class has not been altered or tampered with. In
addition, classes and packages from unknown or untrusted sources are loaded
only if they contain no references to capabilities the user has designated
as restricted, and only classes and packages from sources trusted by the
user will be loaded. These mechanisms can prohibit the spread of viruses
or Trojan horses that may damage or misappropriate user data. </P>

<H2>Features of E</H2>

<P>The E compiler and runtime extend Java. Everything you can do in Java
can be done using E. E-objects and Java objects can both send messages
to E- objects. Both E-objects and Java objects can call Java objects. </P>

<P>In addition, E provides the following: </P>

<H3>Automatic connection management</H3>

<P>E's single messaging facility lets you automatically establish connections
between objects without having to deal directly with the underlying network
protocols. </P>

<H3>Transparent object-to-object communications</H3>

<P>E takes care of details related to network protocols and intersystem
transmissions. A reference to an E-object is the same whether the object
is on the same or remote machines; you do not need to code the network
access details. </P>

<H3>Non-blocking message passing</H3>

<P>E's optimistic programming feature ensures that sending a message can
never &quot;hang&quot; the requesting object. This is because unlike Java
call/return semantics, an object can send a message to another E-object
and immediately continue computing other code. </P>

<H3>Deadlock and race avoidance</H3>

<P>E's messaging model eliminates the need for threads and synchronization.
Deadlock and race conditions are avoided because data can be encapsulated
within an E-object and an E-object will only process one message at a time.
</P>

<H3>Latency compensation</H3>

<P>When optimistic comutation is applied to a network, the likelihood of
parallelism is increased and the likelihood of sequential delays is reduced.
</P>

<H3>Distributed references</H3>

<P>E allows you to distribute references to E-objects over the network.
</P>

<H3>Persistent objects</H3>

<P>E provides a persistent database object. This lets you store your objects
to disk and later recall them to use in other applications. </P>

<H3>Distributed garbage collection</H3>

<P>E's distributed garbage collector can reclaim cycle structures, even
when distributed across the network. </P>

<H3>Access controlled messages and objects</H3>

<P>E provides a set of standard classes and methods that let you restrict
access to the file system and network environment, while retaining the
level of features that you choose. </P>
