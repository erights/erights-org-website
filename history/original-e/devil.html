<p><i>Darius Bacon has translated this example from Original-E as represented
  in this document, to modern <b><font color="#009000">E</font></b>. <a href="http://accesscom.com/%7Edarius/software/e/devil.e">Here</a>
  is the translation. </i></p>
<H2>Prologue</H2>

<P>A virtual die is a software device which produces a uniform stream
of random numbers in the range of 1 through 6. A virtual die can be
used in games of chance.

<P>The formula for rolling a virtual die is pretty simple:

<PRE>          (randomGenerator.nextLong() % 6) + 1
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>Depending on the quality of the source of random numbers, you can
get a good, unpredictable stream of numbers.

<P>Suppose we want to have a game in which two players play together
using two computers connected via the Internet. One way of doing that
is to have one of the computers have a special role. In addition to
representing one of the players, it is also the Game Master (or
Dealer, or Bank, or House), which is the keeper of privileged
knowledge about the state of the game.

<P>Just to make this scenario a little more interesting, imagine that
you are one of the players, and that Satan is the other, and you are
playing a dice game for your immortal soul. When Satan suggests that
his computer (a 666-GHz Pentium XIII) run the Game Master, you become
concerned about the fairness of the game. You don't want Satan
telling you what you rolled.

<P>Satan suggests that a trusted third party's computer run the Game
Master and roll the die, but you are pretty sure that Satan would try
to corrupt or intimidate the third party and hack his computer.

<P>You insist, in the interest of fairness, that the Game Master be
distributed, that it run in both computers, so that you can roll your
die on your machine. Now Satan objects. He doesn't trust your
computer to roll your die honestly, not when your immortal soul is at
stake.

<P>You both agree that you need a fully distributed Game Master that
would have both computers cooperate in every roll of the die in order
to keep the results fair. You further agree that the new Game Master
will be implemented using E, because E is well suited to the
development of secure, distributed applications.

<H2>Act I</H2>

<P>Satan proposes that two <I>eobjects </I>cooperate in the rolling
of the die. Eobjects are objects which communicate by <I>message
passing</I>. Message passing is a very effective communications and
concurrency model for network programming.

<P>The protocol is very simple. The two eobjects both do the
following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<HR>
Select a random number X.

<P>Send X to the other.

<P>Receive the other's X.

<P>Combine the Xs to form the random number that is used to determine
the final result.
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It appears that neither player can force the result of the roll.

<P>The program has two parts: main, which sets up the eobjects and
starts the protocol, and DieRoller, which actually implements the die
rolling protocol. <TT>main</TT> contains the minimum structure
necessary to test DieRoller. We will test DieRoller on a single
machine now, and later replace main with the Game Master framework
that will instantiate the eobjects on different machines.

<PRE>    // Dicing with the Devil: Act I
&nbsp;
    public class DieRolling {
&nbsp;
/*1*/   public static void main(String argv[ ]) {
            DieRoller first = new DieRoller();
            DieRoller second = new DieRoller();
&nbsp;
/*2*/       first &lt;- dieRollStart (second);
            second &lt;- dieRollStart (first);
        }
    }
&nbsp;
    public eclass DieRoller {
        Random randomGenerator = new Random();
&nbsp;
/*3*/   long X = randomGenerator.nextLong();
&nbsp;
/*4 6*/ emethod dieRollStart (DieRoller otherRoller) {
/*5 7*/     otherRoller &lt;- dieRollFinish (X);
        }
&nbsp;
/*10 8*/ emethod dieRollFinish (long otherX) {
/*11 9*/    long finalResult = combine(otherX, X);
&nbsp;
            System.out.println("Roll result = " + finalResult);
        }
&nbsp;
        long combine(long a, long b) {
            return (((a ^ b) % 6) + 1); /*1..6*/
        }
    }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The Walkthrough:

<OL>
   <LI><TT>main</TT> declares and initializes first and second, both
   of eclass <TT>DieRoller</TT>.

   <LI><TT>main</TT> sends the message <TT>dieRollStart</TT> to
   first, passing it a reference to second, and sends the same
   message to second, passing it a reference to first. This informs
   each of the rollers about the other. These messages sends are
   immediate: <TT>main</TT> doesn't wait for the first message to be
   delivered before sending the second one. It just keeps going.
   <TT>main</TT> is complete.

   <LI>The initialization of first and second will select random
   values for <TT>X</TT>.

   <LI>The order of the delivery of the messages sent in step 2 is
   not guaranteed. We will assume that first receives the message
   first. Suddenly, first executes the emethod <TT>dieRollStart</TT>
   in response to receiving the message.

   <LI>first sends the message <TT>dieRollFinish</TT> to second,
   passing <TT>X</TT>. <TT>dieRollStart</TT> is complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, second executes the emethod <TT>dieRollStart</TT> in
   response to receiving the message sent in step 2.

   <LI>second sends the message <TT>dieRollFinish</TT> to first,
   passing <TT>X</TT>. <TT>dieRollStart</TT> is complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, second executes the emethod <TT>dieRollFinish</TT>
   in response to receiving the message sent in step 5.

   <LI>second combines the two <TT>X</TT>s and produces the final
   result. In a real system this would get sent to another eobject
   which would use the result. But this just a sample program, so it
   gets printed instead. <TT>dieRollFinish</TT> is complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, first executes the emethod <TT>dieRollFinish</TT> in
   response to receiving the message sent in step 7.

   <LI>first combines the two <TT>X</TT>s and produces the final
   result. This will be the same result that second produced in step
   9. <TT>dieRollFinish</TT> is complete.
</OL>

<P>The emethods very closely resemble the protocol, so you are
confident that DieRoller accurately implements the protocol. The
protocol itself is very simple and effective. Also, the E security
model gives you confidence that Satan cannot use E to hack your
computer over the network.

<P>Unfortunately, it is not possible to guarantee that Satan is
running this code on his computer. Because his computer is under his
infernal control, he can hack it. There is no way to prevent someone
from hacking his own machine, and there is no way to prove absolutely
that a machine has not been hacked. Therefore, it is bad practice to
place too much trust in any computer.

<P>If Satan does hack his machine, then he could corrupt the
protocol. An evil version of DieRoller might look like this:

<PRE>      evilclass DieRoller {
          DieRoller other;
&nbsp;
          evilmethod dieRollStart (DieRoller otherRoller) {
              other = otherRoller;
          }
&nbsp;
          evilmethod dieRollFinish (long otherX) {
               other &lt;- dieRollFinish (cheat(X, desiredResult));
          }
      }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>(Note: <TT>evilclass</TT> and <TT>evilmethod</TT> are not legal
keywords in E or Java. Satan has his own custom programming tools.)

<P>In the evilmethod <TT>dieRollStart</TT>, Satan doesn't send his
<TT>X</TT>. Instead, he just remembers the other's reference. When
<TT>dieRollFinish</TT> arrives, he knows your random number and you
don't know his. He now has enough information to compute an
<TT>X</TT> that will force the result to be what he desires.

<P>If you choose to hack your machine in the same way, then the game
will stall because both machines will be waiting for the other to
send its <TT>X</TT> first. Only the player going last can benefit
from cheating.

<H2>Act II</H2>

<P>Satan is offended when you ask for design changes in DieRoller to
correct the potential insecurity found in Act I, but he very quickly
produces a new version with a tighter protocol. The new version of
DieRoller makes use of two additional features of E: channels and
ewhen.

<P>A <I>channel</I> is a special eobject which stores and forwards
messages. Every channel has a distributor associated with it.
Forwarding a distributor to an eobject will cause all of the messages
sent to the associated channel to be forwarded to that eobject.
Channels make it possible to send a message to an eobject that
doesn't exist yet. Uninitialized eobjects are channels by default.

<P><I>ewhen</I> is an E statement which creates a new object (called
a closure) which will execute a block of code when a particular
eobject has a value.

<P>Satan's new protocol uses a one-way hash which will prevent the
changing of <TT>X</TT>. A one-way hash is a function that is
extremely difficult to reverse. The protocol can be divided into two
halves: The half that first runs, and the half that second runs. This
is first's half:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<HR>
Select a random number X.

<P>Send the one-way function of X to second.

<P>After receiving the second's X, reveal X.

<P>The X s are combined to produce the final result.
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is second's half:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<HR>
Select a random number X.

<P>After receiving the hash of first's X, reveal X.

<P>The Xs are combined to produce the final result.

<P>Recompute the one-way hash of first's X to verify that first did
not change its X when it learned second's X.
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Shuffling the halves together, we can see the complete protocol:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<HR>
The two eobjects, first and second, each select a random number X.

<P>first reveals a one-way hash of its X.

<P>Then second reveals its X.

<P>Then first reveals its X.

<P>The Xs are combined to produce the finalResult.

<P>Second recomputes the one-way hash of first's X to verify that
first did not change its X after it learned second's X. That would be
cheating.
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Satan assures you that if he attempts to cheat, you will be able
to detect it. Once again, you are invited to observe that the
emethods closely resemble the protocol.

<P>The Walkthrough:

<OL>
   <LI><TT>main</TT> declares and initializes first and second, both
   of eclass <TT>DieRoller</TT>.

   <LI><TT>main</TT> sends the message <TT>dieRollFirst</TT> to
   first, passing it a reference to second. <TT>main</TT> is
   complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, first executes the emethod <TT>dieRollFirst</TT> in
   response to receiving the message sent in step 2.

   <LI>first chooses a random number <TT>X</TT>.

   <LI>first sends the message <TT>dieRollSecond</TT> to second,
   passing a hashed <TT>X</TT>, the uninitialized ELong
   <TT>concealedX</TT>, and the distributor for the channel
   representing the uninitialized ELong <TT>hisX</TT>.

   <LI>first executes an ewhen statement that says, "When
   <TT>hisX</TT> gets a value, assign its value to <TT>otherX</TT>
   and execute the following code block." <TT>dieRollFirst</TT> is
   complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, second executes the emethod <TT>dieRollSecond</TT>
   in response to receiving the message sent in step 5.

   <LI>second chooses a random number <TT>X</TT>.

   <LI>second reveals its <TT>X</TT> by forwarding <TT>myX</TT>.

   <LI>second executes an ewhen statement that says, "When
   <TT>firstX</TT> gets a value, assign its value to <TT>otherX</TT>
   and execute the following code block." <TT>dieRollSecond</TT> is
   complete.

   <LI>Suddenly, <TT>hisX</TT> has a value (as a result of step 9),
   so first begins execution of the code in the ewhen (as a result of
   line 6).

   <LI>first forwards the value of its <TT>X</TT> to
   <TT>concealedX</TT>, completing its half of the protocol. The
   ewhen is complete.

   <LI>first computes the <TT>finalResult</TT> by combining its
   <TT>X</TT> and second's <TT>X</TT>.

   <LI>Suddenly, <TT>firstX</TT> has a value (as a result of step
   12), so second begins execution of the code in the ewhen block (as
   a result of step 10).

   <LI>second computes the <TT>finalResult</TT> by combining its
   <TT>X</TT> and first's <TT>X</TT>.

   <LI>second verifies the <TT>otherHash</TT> value it received from
   first in step 7. If it doesn't match, then do something about it.
   If this were a real program, ethrow a <TT>cheatingDetected</TT>
   eexception. But this is only a sample program, so just print a
   message. The ewhen is complete. The protocol is complete.
</OL>

<P>One nice feature of this version is that second can't cheat.
Unfortunately, first can still cheat in a number of ways.

<P>First knows the result before second does, and if first is unhappy
about the result it could cause a network failure to prevent the
conclusion of the protocol. This attack doesn't help him to win, but
it does allow him to avoid losing.

<PRE>        evilmethod dieRollFirst (DieRoller otherRoller) {
            long X = randomGenerator.nextLong();
&nbsp;
            ELong concealedX, hisX;
            otherRoller &lt;- dieRollSecond (oneWayHash(X),
                    concealedX, &amp;hisX);
&nbsp;
            ewhen hisX (long otherX) {
                if (combine(X, otherX) == desiredResult) {
                    &amp;concealedX &lt;- forward (new ELong(X));
                } else {
                    simulate_network_failure();
                }
            }
        }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>This sort of attack is difficult to avoid without the use of a
trusted intermediary. You might want to deal with this contractually:
If there is a network failure during the final die roll of the game,
then you win. This way you won't be risking your immortal soul on a
bug in a socket manager.

<P>There may also be a more serious attack on the one-way hash. There
may be two or more inputs that will produce the same output. These
are called collisions. If Satan has a set of candidate <TT>X</TT>s
that all produce the same hash, then he can freely select among them,
defeating the cheating-detection feature. In preparation, Satan may
have done an exhaustive search for collisions. He can then use this
knowledge to change his choice of <TT>X</TT> without detection:

<PRE>            &amp;concealedX &lt;- forward (new ELong(cheat
                   (desiredResult, otherX)));
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>This is similar to having Satan write his <TT>X</TT> on a piece of
paper. When he sees your guess, he reveals the paper. If he would
have lost on 666, he turns it over and says it's 999.

<H2>Act III</H2>

<P>"The third time's the charm," says Satan as he whips out his
latest protocol, intended to fix the weakness discovered in Act II.

<P>Both sides use this protocol:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<HR>
Select two random numbers, X and R. R will be used to prevent a
precomputed attack on the one-way function.

<P>Reveal R.

<P>After learning the other's R, reveal the one-way hash of X mixed
with R. The R mixture defeats the hash collision attack from Act II.

<P>After learning the other's hash, reveal X.

<P>After learning the other's X, combine the Xs to produce the
finalResult.

<P>Verify that there was no cheating.
<HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This version uses nested ewhen statements. Using ewhen with
channels allows for an interactive protocol without having to have
many emethods. It also prevents attacks which alter the proper
sequencing of messages.

<P>This version is much stronger than Act II, but it is also more
expensive. The program passes many more messages, so it is
measurably, if not noticeably, slower. Is it safe? It is certainly
safer. Is it safe enough? Would you bet your immortal soul on it?

<P>One possible attack is on the Java Random function. The protocol
requires that each side draw two random numbers, <TT>X</TT> and
<TT>R</TT>, immediately revealing <TT>R</TT>. If knowledge of
weakness in the design and implementation of Java Random makes it
possible to predict <TT>X</TT> from <TT>R</TT>, then it may still be
insecure.

<H2>Epilogue</H2>

<P>You might be wondering, "How far must we go in order to prevent an
extremely unlikely attack?" These attacks are difficult and time
consuming. In fact, the attack suggested in Act I has never occurred,
but we believe that it is possible. The situations to watch for are
the ones in which it might be worth the trouble. As the Internet
grows in size and importance, there will be more and more situations
which are worth the trouble.

<P>One benefit of E is that it can make the attacks more difficult
and time consuming, but E cannot by itself repel all possible
attacks. Nothing can. E makes it possible to write secure,
distributed applications, for some practical definition of the word
"secure." Use of E does not automatically assure that programs will
be secure.

<P>For some purposes, the solution in Act I may be completely
adequate, but with this caution:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>It is not unusual for the purpose or use or scope of
software to change over its life. Rarely are the security properties
of software systems reexamined in the context of new or evolving
missions. This leads to insecure systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you design systems as though your immortal soul depended on
them, then you will tend to build more reliable systems.
