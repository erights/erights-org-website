  <P><FONT size=-1><I>Electric Communities has developed a distributed garbage 
  collector that identifies and collects garbaged objects in a distributed 
  network, especially those involved in cycles. It uses a unique technology that 
  can identify these cycles without having to check redundant relationship paths 
  between the objects; this makes it faster and more efficient than other 
  garbage collectors. The EC Distributed Garbage Collector works in conjunction 
  with the local garbage collector on each user's machine, providing a 
  multi-tiered approach to garbage collection that can work with any distributed 
  object system.</I></FONT>

  <P>In the object-oriented world, garbage collection is a process that 
  effectively deletes obsolete objects from machine memory. An object becomes 
  obsolete when it is no longer required or referenced by any other existing 
  object. However, these obsolete objects continue to tie up the machine's 
  memory. Accordingly, identifying and collecting these objects is important to 
  maximize the efficient operation of the machine; if collection of these 
  objects lags too far behind their obsolescence, overall machine performance 
  can degrade. 
  <P>Current solutions to object garbage collection are quite efficient when all 
  the objects are located on one machine. However, they are not nearly as 
  effective for a system where objects on different machines are referencing 
  each other, especially when trying to identify cycles of objects spanning 
  multiple machines. In contrast, the EC Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) 
  provides an economical solution to marking these obsolete cycles of objects 
  and reclaiming resources among the network. It works with any system of 
  distributed objects. 
  <P> 
  <H2>Terms used in this document</H2>This document presents a summary of the 
  DGC technology, which is based on identifying and collecting cycles of 
  objects. It uses the following terms: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Rooted object.</B> This is an object that is recognized as 
    persistent, and therefore should not be collected. An example in Java is the 
    top-level object containing the <TT>main</TT> function code. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Locally rooted object. </B>This is an object referenced by a rooted 
    object on the same machine. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Remotely rooted object.</B> This is an object referenced only by 
    objects in remote machines, and all references originate from one or more 
    locally rooted objects. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Cycles of objects.</B> A cycle of objects involves two or more 
    objects that reference each other.

  <H2>Catching cycles of distributed objects</H2>To maintain optimal 
  performance, the system needs to identify cycles of objects for garbage 
  collection. By definition, a cycle of objects becomes a candidate for garbage 
  collection when none of the objects represent a rooted object, either local or 
  remote. 
  <P>Collecting obsolete cycles is important because they can: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Maintain unnecessary connections that could be shut down. This is 
    especially true for implicit connections, where 1) an object A is implicitly 
    connected to an object C through an object B, and 2) object B then 
    disconnects. This leaves object A with a now unnecessary connection to 
    object C. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Consume resources such as memory and disk space. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Cause network traffic; even though objects are garbage, they can still 
    send messages to each other. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Directly affect scalability, performance and reliability of service 
    servers. If a specific event generates some cyclical trash, it would not 
    take many of those events to fill up a server, since they will be constantly 
    accumulating. Taking the server off-line to remedy the situation could be 
    unacceptable in a commercial system. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>Discovering cycles of objects for collection is 
  straightforward on a single machine with few objects. However, when cycles 
  become distributed across multiple machines, catching them with current 
  solutions is neither easy nor economical. Consider the current 
  <I>mark-and-sweep</I> and <I>reference counting</I> systems: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Mark-and-sweep solutions must first poll every object on every machine 
    before any object can be declared garbage. This is expensive in a networked 
    environment, with the expense increasing in direct proportion to the number 
    of machines on the network. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Reference counting systems do not even check for cycles of objects at 
    all. </LI></UL>The DGC technology, in contrast, is geared specifically for a 
  distributed system, considerably reducing the number of message sent across 
  the network during a garbage collection cycle. 
  <H2>How the DGC works</H2>A DGC process uses the following algorithm. 
  <BR>&nbsp; 
  <TABLE>
    <TBODY>

      <TD><FONT face=arial,helvetica,swiss><FONT size=-1><B>FIGURE 4.</B> Flow 
        of a DGC process.</FONT></FONT>

    <TR>
      <TD><IMG src="images/fig4.bmp" 
        border=1></TD>
    </TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp; 
  <OL>
    <LI><B>Process is triggered.</B> The garbage collection process can be 
    activated by several events: 
    <P> 
    <DL>
      <DD>An object is detected in the network's suspect list (see the following 
      step). 
      <P>&nbsp;A preset time period has expired. 
      <P>&nbsp;An asynchronous event occurs, such as when available memory 
      becomes critical. 
      <P>&nbsp;</P></DD></DL>
    <LI><B>Scan suspect object list. </B>The DGC checks to see if there are any 
    objects in the suspect object list. An object A can become suspect in two 
    different ways: 
    <P> 
    <DL>
      <DD>A locally rooted object with remote references both from and to other 
      objects becomes suspect when it no longer is locally rooted. 
      <P>&nbsp;A remotely rooted object becomes suspect when it loses one or 
      more of its remote references.</P></DD></DL>The DGC relies on the local 
    garbage collector on each machine to determine if an object is suspect. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Transmit rooted-status request to referring objects.</B> If an object 
    A is marked as suspect, the DGC gives it a unique session identifier. It 
    then sends a message from object A to all the objects in the primary level 
    of A's inverse reference graph (that is, all remote objects directly 
    referring to A--see the inverse reference graph at the beginning of this 
    document for a visual representation), tagging the message with the 
    identifier. This message asks each object if it is locally rooted. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Referencing objects process request. </B>A referencing object B 
    processes the root-status request according to the following rules: 
    <P> 
    <DL>
      <DD>If object B is already processing a request with the same identifier, 
      it knows the request is redundant, and returns a DISREGARD to object A. 
      <P>&nbsp;If object B is locally rooted, it returns a YES to object A. 
      <P>&nbsp;If object B is not locally rooted, it forwards the requests in 
      turn to all of the objects in its branch of A's inverse reference graph; 
      that is, the objects in A's secondary level that directly reference B. If 
      these secondary objects are not locally rooted, they repeat the request 
      process to their referencing objects in A's tertiary level, and so on. 
      <P>&nbsp;While B is waiting for its request to resolve, it might receive 
      the same request message from another object. If this message has the same 
      identifier, B knows the request is redundant, and returns a DISREGARD to 
      object A. 
      <P>&nbsp;If B receives replies from all its referenced objects and none of 
      them are locally rooted, it returns a DISREGARD to object A. 
      <P>&nbsp;</P></DD></DL>
    <LI><B>DGC processes all replies to the suspect object. </B>The DGC 
    processes the message replies according to the following rules: 
    <P> 
    <DL>
      <DD>If object A received a YES from any of its referenced objects, the DGC 
      marks it as remotely rooted, and does not collect it. 
      <P>If object A receives replies from all its objects and none of them are 
      locally rooted, the DGC marks it as garbage. 
      <P>&nbsp;</P></DD></DL>In either case, object A is then removed from the 
    suspect list. 
    <P> 
    <P>A major feature of this algorithm is the DISREGARD message. A DISREGARD 
    signals that a particular object is already processing a root status request 
    with the same ID number. Therefore, the message does not need to be 
    forwarded along that particular branch of the suspect object's inverse 
    reference graph. This lets the DGC know that it can disregard that 
    particular branch during the evaluation process. Not having to check 
    redundant object cycle paths can significantly reduce the number of messages 
    the DGC sends across the network. 
    <H3>Implementation 
    <HR>
    </H3>The DGC works in conjunction with the local garbage collection system. 
    Its primary focus is on identifying/collecting cycles spanning multiple 
    machines, and presumes that each machine has some local garbage collection 
    process to perform the following functions: 
    <P> 
    <UL>
      <LI>Catch and collect isolated obsoleted objects on the local machine. 
      This includes cycles of objects that exist only on one machine. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Determine when an object changes local or remote rooted status, 
      therefore marking it suspect. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Traverse local reference paths of objects on its machines to help 
      create the suspect object's inverse reference graph. </LI></UL>This provides 
    a multi-tiered approach to garbage collection. On the local end, each 
    participating machine can still take advantage of its garbage collector's 
    ability to inexpensively clean up local garbage. The network also benefits 
    from the DGC's cleanup of distributed cycles. 
    <P>The DGC operates independently of the local garbage collector (see step 1 
    of the algorithm for events that can trigger a DGC process). Because the DGC 
    is not responsible for cleaning up garbage for the entire system, you do not 
    need to run it as frequently. 
    <H3>Security and reliability 
    <HR>
    </H3>The DGC has a number of built-in features that protect the security and 
    reliability of the distributed environment: 
    <UL>
      <LI>Unlike other garbage collectors, the DGC does not let the garbaged 
      object tell its referenced objects to also destroy themselves. This is an 
      important security feature on a system with multiple users. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Conversely, the DGC also does not tell objects pointing to the 
      garbaged object to destroy themselves automatically, even though by the 
      algorithm's definition they are also garbage. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>If there is a connection failure on one of the machines in the suspect 
      object's inverse reference graph, all the remote references to the object 
      on the failed machine also drop. This in turn makes the object on the 
      dropped node either 1) garbage (if there were only one reference, which 
      got dropped with the connection failure), or 2) suspect itself (if there 
      were multiple references, one of which got dropped with the failed 
      connection). In the latter situation, the now-suspect object runs its own 
      DGC process to find out its status. In either situation, the object passes 
      its status back to the original suspect object. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>The DISREGARD message is a built-in defense against deadlocks. Since 
      an object replies with a DISREGARD rather than a "wait" message to another 
      root status request with the same ID, objects do not wait for each other 
      to furnish a response. </LI></UL><A name=HEADING1-64></A>
    <H2>Benefits of the DGC</H2>In summary, the DGC provides several notable 
    features: 
    <UL>
      <LI>Identifies and collects garbaged cycles of distributed objects 
      spanning multiple machines. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Uses a unique technology that identifies these cycles without having 
      to check redundant branches of an object's inverse reference graph. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Works in conjunction with the local garbage collector. This makes it 
      easy to implement with your current system. It also takes advantage of the 
      local collector's ability to clean up local garbage inexpensively. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Works asynchronously with the local garbage collector. It can be 
      activated independently of the local collector by several criteria; for 
      example, when a preset time period has expired, or by an asynchronous 
      event such as when available memory becomes critical. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Does not rely on polling every object on every machine to identify 
      suspect objects. Instead, suspect objects are identified locally, which is 
      much less expensive for the network. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Prevents deadlock situations with the DISREGARD message. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Can work with any system of distributed objects. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI>Helps maintain the security of the network by preventing 1) an object 
      targeted for collection from telling other referenced objects to destroy 
      themselves, and 2) objects pointing to a garbaged object from destroying 
      themselves automatically.

    <H2>How to obtain more information</H2>Electric Communities' Distributed 
    Garbage Collector can be incorporated into any distributed object system. It 
    is already implemented with the Java(TM) Garbage Collector as part of the E 
    runtime. For more information on obtaining the DGC, contact Electric 
    Communities at the address listed at the end of this document. 
    <H2>A word about E</H2>E is a set of extensions to Java designed for writing 
    distributed applications including databases, groupware, publishing systems, 
    multimedia, and games. E builds upon the Java Virtual Machine. E classes are 
    very similar to Java classes, and the two can coexist in the same program. 
    However, an E-object responds only to <I>messages</I> sent by other objects, 
    rather than using the traditional call/return semantics of Java methods. 
    When an E-object receives a message, it executes an associated 
    <I>E-method</I> that defines what to do when the class receives that 
    message. 
    <P>E provides some powerful enhancements to Java, including: 
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Distributed communication.</B> E features a built-in model for 
      remote object communications, allowing an object to send messages directly 
      to objects that exist in other machines. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI><B>Capability semantics.</B> E offers a sophisticated security model 
      that allows convenient but extremely detailed control over sensitive 
      functions within a single machine or across a network. 
      <P> </P>
      <LI><B>Optimistic computation.</B> E implements a powerful method for 
      reducing the effect of communications latency in distributed systems.
