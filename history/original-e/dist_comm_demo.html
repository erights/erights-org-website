<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For commerce to flourish on the Internet, it's becoming clear that developers
need efficient tools to build secure commercial applications. This demo,
while simple in design, is a metaphor for the larger picture of how to
implement distributed commerce on the Internet using E. The E Extensions
to Java from Electric Communities provide essential resources for writing
secure, distributed applications. </P>

<H2>Elements of the Demo </H2>

<P><A NAME="1029382"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This demo implements a secure, distributed, commercial environment that
is easy to create using the E Extensions to Java. There are several main
components of this demo:</P>

<P> </P>

<UL>
<LI>There is one virtual space that simulates a single commercial environment.
This environment is shared by three machines running different platforms:
Sun Solaris, Windows NT, and Windows 95. Shared objects (owned by the participating
machines) are traded in this virtual space. <A NAME="1029426"></A></LI>

<LI>The machines sharing this virtual space are able to communicate over
the network with no central server. If any machine is shut down, the virtual
space is still retained in the two surviving machines, minus the objects
that were owned by the downed machine. <A NAME="1028897"></A></LI>

<LI>The machines can create objects that are shared in the virtual space,
yet retain ownership of the individual objects they create. Each machine
knows not only about its own objects, but also the objects on the other
machines. <A NAME="1028920"></A></LI>

<LI>Objects can be owned and traded. A machine creating an object has trusted
ownership of that object, and can transfer that ownership to another machine.
<A NAME="1028899"></A></LI>

<LI>Trading takes place according to a set of established rules on how
ownership is determined and transferred. </LI>

<H2>Where to obtain E and this demo code</H2>

<P><A NAME="1029159"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All the code for this demo will be made available online at the Electric
Communities web site at <TT>http://www.communities.com</TT>, along with
the E extensions themselves and documentation. The objects in this demo
are fully inheritable, and you can use them as a foundation for building
your own applications.</P>

<H2>Demo overview</H2>

<P><A NAME="1029737"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this demo, a single virtual space (representing a commercial environment)
has a representation on three machines, each running a different platform.
The machines can communicate with each other, yet each is fully independent
of the others.</P>

<P> <A NAME="1029738"></A>A machine can create an object to be shared in
this virtual space. It creates an object by choosing it from a pulldown<B>
</B>menu. Any machine creating an object owns that object. When a machine
creates an object, a <I>presence</I>, or representation of that object,
is also instantiated on the other machines. Any action taken by the object
(for example, moving it around) is mirrored by the presences on the other
machines. A window at the bottom of the screen shows what objects the machine
owns. This window is updated each time the machine either creates or trades
an object.</P>

<P> <A NAME="1029739"></A>To trade an object, the machines use the <B>Trading
Table</B> dialog. The Trading Table is an object itself that is independent
of the machines; none of the machines own it. Any machine can propose a
trade. For example, assume machine A wants to buy a red dot from Machine
B. Machine A can see the red dot, since it appears as a presence on its
workspace. However, to have actual ownership, it proposes a trade with
Machine B. </P>

<P><A NAME="1029740"></A>To do this, Machine A brings up the <B>Trading
Table</B> and drags its presence of the red dot to it, and any objects
it offers to trade in turn (for example, a green square). The <B>Trading
Table</B> with this proposed trade then appears on Machine B. Machine B
can either ignore this trade proposal, or counter it by offering other
objects to exchange (for example, it can propose that Machine A trade 2
green squares in exchange for the red dot). When both machines are satisfied
by the offer, they click the <B>Trade</B> button. The objects then exchange
ownership, which is reflected in the bottom window.</P>

<P> <A NAME="1029741"></A>Note that in order to trade an object, the machine
must actually have ownership of that object. Machine A could not have traded
its two green squares if it did not own them. </P>

<H2>The benefits of a decentralized commercial environment</H2>

<P><A NAME="1028336"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Building commercial applications is nothing new. Many programmers today
are coding programs similar to the one modeled by this demo. However, these
applications generally operate on a strict client/server model--there is
one central server machine, and multiple client machines. The server owns
all the objects, and must ``approve'' all transactions among the clients.
</P>

<P><A NAME="1028636"></A>Using a client/server approach can work for many
situations. However, a major advantage to a decentralized commercial environment
is its scalability. It's much easier to scale a decentralized environment
to a larger community because processing can be distributed among the various
machines; you don't have the problem of a central server eventually overloading
as your system grows larger.</P>

<H2>Using E to build decentralized applications</H2>

<P><A NAME="1029116"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The E Extensions to Java are ideal for creating distributed applications
such as the decentralized commercial environment in this demo. This is
because E has built-in functionality for secure remote object communications.
Any Java or E-object (which is a Java object with added E functionality)
can send a message to another E-object, even if that E-object is on a different
machine on the network; the objects do not need to know anything about
underlying network protocols. </P>

<P><A NAME="1028343"></A>Because many of the communications details are
already built into E, you don't have to manually code things like:</P>

<P> </P>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="1028471"></A></P>

<LI>Streams and threads <A NAME="1028481"></A></LI>

<LI>Network access details like socket interfaces, pipes, or any other
underlying network protocol. </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1030396"></A>For example, in some systems, if different nodes
on a network need to communicate, you must explicitly include the addresses
of those nodes and their communications protocols in the code. E, on the
other hand, does this automatically.</P>

<P> <A NAME="1029813"></A>And E lets you do things that are very difficult
to program in other languages. For example, consider some these technical
highlights of this demo (for more information on E concepts, see the <I>E
Programmer's Guide</I>):</P>

<P> </P>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="1030610"></A></P>

<LI>When an object is created, the demo code automatically creates not
only the original E-object on the owner machine, but also a remote presence
of this object on all the other machines at the same time. It gives these
presences a reference back to the original object in the form of a <I>channel</I>.
A channel is a conduit object that carries messages from one object to
another. Using this channel, each presence ``reports back'' to the original
object to register itself. <A NAME="1029832"></A></LI>

<LI>Since all the remote presences register themselves with the original
object in this manner, the object has a list of all its remote instantiations.
It can then simultaneously broadcast various messages to all of its presences
at once (for example, a <TT>move</TT> message). <A NAME="1029892"></A></LI>

<LI>In this demo, ownership is denoted by having the registrar of remote
presences. When the machine trades an object, the trade message is broadcast
to all remote presences. The presences then know to subsequently register
themselves with and report to the object on the new machine. The registrar
is thus transferred to the new machine, which means that it is now the
owner of the object. <A NAME="1029847"></A></LI>

<LI>The <B>Trading Table</B> is an independent E-object that can be instantiated,
but not owned, on any of the machines. It uses E's <I>deferring statements</I>
(such as <TT>eif</TT>) to ensure that it can wait for resolution on a proposed
trade, and still be able to reject other trade offers while waiting for
this resolution. </LI>

<P><A NAME="1030333"></A>E's deferring statements let your program continue
executing even if a certain code block is waiting for a value to be furnished.
If it receives a value, that code block executes.</P>

<P> </P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1029146"></A>In addition to this distributed application functionality,
E is built on Java. You can take full advantage of E's distributed communication
functionality and easily integrate it with your Java code. </P>
