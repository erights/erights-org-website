<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Electric Communities has developed a set of extensions
to Java, called E, to help developers write distributed applications. E
combines Sun's Java programming language with some powerful enhancements:
communications extensions for the development of distributed applications;
optimistic computation, a powerful method for reducing the effect of communications
latency in distributed systems; and an improved security model based on
capability semantics and public-key cryptography, permitting fine-grained
control over access to system resources without sacrificing security.</FONT></I>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>E is intended for programmers writing network applications,
including databases, groupware, publishing systems, and multimedia.</FONT></I>

<H2>
What is E?</H2>
E is a programming language designed for developers who write distributed
applications. It builds on the strength of Sun's Java language, an open
standard that already provides some flexibility for developers writing
World Wide Web applets. However, developers are finding that Java is not
well suited to more ambitious distributed applications because Java's incomplete
security model requires unacceptable trade-offs between expressive power
and safety.

<P>The E language improves on Java's security model and provides other
powerful communications-oriented features. These include:
<UL>
<LI>
Distributed communication: E features a built-in model for remote object
communications, allowing an object to send messages directly to objects
that exist in other machines.</LI>

<LI>
Capability semantics: a sophisticated security model that allows for extremely
detailed control over sensitive functions within a single machine or across
a network.</LI>

<LI>
Optimistic computation: a powerful method for reducing the effect of communications
latency in distributed systems.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Distributed Communication</H2>
Distributed communication provides a single messaging facility that allows
an object to send a message to another object, even if the other object
is in a different machine on the network. The E language lets a programmer
automatically establish connections between objects without having to deal
directly with the underlying network protocols.
<H2>
Capability Semantics</H2>
E's capability semantics provides a security model based on the use of
capabilities, which grant permissions to send particular messages to particular
objects in a distributed system.

<P>E's security model is quite different from Java's. Java's basic assumption
is simple: all code that originated on the local hard disk drive is trusted;
all code that originated from the network is not trusted. Based on this
model, Java provides system security by checking each time a "potentially
dangerous" method is invoked; if no untrusted class is on the stack, the
method is allowed to execute.

<P>This all-or-nothing approach can be secure, but it has some basic weaknesses.
A Java applet that establishes network connections, reads a configuration
file, or manipulates a database, must first be downloaded to the user's
local hard disk. Once it is local, that code is automatically assumed to
be completely trustworthy. It is entrusted with resources that it might
not need, which can help foster viruses and trojan horses. It is not possible
in Java to assign access selectively, on an as-needed basis. In order to
grant some power to an applet, all powers must be granted.

<P>In contrast to Java's all-or-nothing model, E's approach to system protection
is flexible and general. E's security model is built on its distributed
communications and capabilities semantics features. Security is maintained
by restricting the ability of objects to send specific messages to specific
objects. It is impossible for an object to send an unauthorized message.
Once the capability to reference an object or send a message has been granted,
no further run-time check is required.

<P>Capabilities are granted to E objects at load time. A cryptographic
signature and a set of capability requirements are attached to every E
object. The E object can have several kinds of "trustedness," independent
of whether it exists on the local hard disk or whether it originated on
the network. Based on the trustedness of the signature, the set of capabilities
is granted or refused.

<P>For example, you would not want to give a relatively untrusted application
the ability to write anywhere in the file system. But you might want to
give that application the ability to add a limited number of records to
a database, and nothing else. By creating a trusted object that implements
limited capabilities, and giving the untrusted application the ability
to send messages to this new object, you can obtain more interesting functionality
from the untrusted code without compromising security.
<H2>
Optimistic Computation</H2>
Optimistic computation helps solve the troublesome problems of deadlock
and race conditions which plague distributed systems. E's implementation
of optimistic computation lets your program send a message to an object
requesting a value, and still continue executing the rest of the code "optimistically"
as if it already has the answer it needs.

<P>Optimistic computation simplifies design and increases reliability while
decreasing network latency. E implements this by adding channels to its
distributed communications model.

<P>E classes rely on sending messages rather than on the traditional call/return
semantics of Java. Messages do not have return results; they are merely
sent. When an object actually requires a value as the result of sending
a message to another object, it includes a channel as one of the message
parameters. The channel acts as a container into which the result will
be placed. The object providing the channel uses it as a reference to the
return value and can begin sending messages to it immediately, even before
the actual value has been determined. Thus, the sender of the message can
continue executing without stopping to wait for the result. E also includes
an exception handling mechanism to deal with bad messages or return values
that never materialize.

<P>By allowing computation to continue, more messages can be sent over
the network in a given period of time, allowing for better utilization
of the available bandwidth. Because many message roundtrips can now overlap,
total latency is effectively reduced.

<P>Another advantage of optimistic computation is the elimination of unnecessary
network roundtrips. As a protocol is carried out, channels can be nested
within channels so that the anticipated result can be altered "through
the pipeline," as it were, before it is actually received. A series of
messages with commands such as "multiply these," "add one to the result,"
"send your result to the following object" can be sent through a series
of channels without ever requiring a packet to be received back across
the network. Thus, latency is reduced because fewer network round trips
are made.

<P>E's message passing semantics eliminates deadlocks and the need for
locking. Only one method at a time may be executed by a single instance
of an E object, if that object contains mutable state information.

<P>By operating under these assumptions, the E environment guarantees that
object state information will remain consistent and that processes can
execute to completion.
<H2>
E Classes and Java Classes</H2>
E classes can interoperate with standard Java classes. The coding of E
methods is similar to Java method coding, with some syntactic extensions.
E classes can contain ordinary Java methods internally.

<P>The E environment still utilizes Java's call and return semantics for
communication between Java objects. Between E objects, however, optimistic
computation is used. E classes can encapsulate Java code, enabling it to
interact with other E objects optimistically.
<H2>
Product Features</H2>
The E language is implemented as a compiler that maps E source code directly
into Java byte codes. Java and E code can coexist in the same program--you
can write Java classes in an E program, and implement private Java methods
within E classes. Since E is built on Java, you can take full advantage
of E features and yet easily integrate it with your Java code.

<P>The E product includes a runtime library that supports E features such
as security management, object persistence, communications, and access-controlled
objects. There is also a unique distributed garbage collector that works
with local collection systems to identify and collect obsolete cycles of
objects on the network.

<P>The E product also includes an example suite, which demonstrate E's
unique feature set. The product documentation includes example source code
and conceptual explanations.
<H2>
Summary</H2>
E adds this set of powerful features to the popular Java language, transforming
it from an applet language to a language for distributed applications:
<UL>
<LI>
Transparent object-to-object communications</LI>

<LI>
Non-blocking message send</LI>

<LI>
Automatic connection management</LI>

<LI>
Access controlled messages and objects</LI>

<LI>
Cryptographic capability management</LI>

<LI>
Deadlock and race avoidance</LI>

<LI>
Latency compensation</LI>

<LI>
Interoperability with Java</LI>

<LI>
Orthogonal persistence</LI>

<LI>
Distributed garbage collection</LI>
</UL>
Remember that E allows developers to create secure applications, but it
cannot guarantee security on its own. The features that E provides must
be utilized with care and common sense on the part of developers.
