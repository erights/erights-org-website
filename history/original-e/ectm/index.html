  <P><I><FONT size=-1>Electric Communities has designed and implemented a 
  capability-based security infrastructure for certificates that goes far beyond 
  simple digital signatures. Applying EC's Trust Manager to Java provides a 
  powerful and extensible semantics that lets users specify and enforce highly 
  complex trust relationships governing the load-time behavior of Java 
  classes--class importing, subclassing of other classes, and package 
  membership. Adapting the Trust Manager to Java required only a few changes to 
  the Java runtime; for example, adding it to the standard Sun distribution 
  requires changes to only one source file. EC's Trust Manager was customized to 
  Java as part of the E programming language effort, but it also is a 
  stand-alone product that can be added to any licensed Java 
  implementation.</FONT></I> <BR>
  <HR>

  <P>Java(TM), Sun Microsystems' platform-independent programming language and 
  runtime environment, has taken the computing community by storm. Initial 
  distributions of the language runtime allow some user control over the 
  delegation of trust to Java classes, but developers of distributed 
  applications have expressed the need for a more flexible and powerful security 
  model. Javasoft, Microsoft, and other vendors have announced plans to 
  implement digital signatures for Java classes, based on the techniques of 
  public-key cryptography, that address part of the security picture for 
  distributed applications. 
  <P>Electric Communities' Trust Manager (ECTM) is a security framework that 
  propagates trust through security policies composed from mutually suspicious 
  sources. This allows the revocable delegation of domain-specific powers to 
  trusted agencies (such as a company MIS department or network system 
  administrator) as represented by their digital public keys. This framework is 
  specialized by adding code defining the kinds of operations needing 
  authorization in a given domain, and intercepting these operations so the 
  Trust Manager can calculate whether they should be allowed. 
  <P>Electric Communities has provided a Java-specific implementation of the 
  ECTM that solves several security issues in the Java Language, including 
  issues highlighted by the Java Security Manager and signed classes. This 
  customized ECTM, called ECTM/J, is a tool that lets the user make and enforce 
  assertions controlling: 
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>The ability of Java classes to import other classes. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The ability of Java classes to subclass other classes. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Membership of Java classes in particular packages. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>This white paper outlines the differences between the 
  initial Java security model and EC's Trust Manager for Java, presents the 
  mechanism used by ECTM/J to enforce users' security preferences, and 
  illustrates the power and flexibility of the ECTM security mechanism.

  <H3>Security in Current Java Releases 
  <HR>
  </H3>A number of companies are pursuing the development of security 
  enhancements to Java. In this white paper, we compare our Trust Manager only 
  to the version of Java currently in release. 
  <P>The security model for the current release of Java works as follows: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Classes that can potentially damage the user's system, such as writing 
    arbitrarily to the hard disk, are designated by their authors as 
    "dangerous". Calling classes not designated "dangerous" is always allowed. 
    <LI>In each dangerous method of a dangerous class, the author must include 
    calls to Java's Security manager, asking it to check the context in which 
    the call is made. 
    <LI>The Security Manager examines the current execution stack and evaluates 
    each class as "trusted" or "untrusted". In general, classes residing on the 
    user's hard disk are regarded as trusted; classes originating from elsewhere 
    on the network may be considered trusted or untrusted based on a 
    user-configurable default. 
    <P>&nbsp;

          <I>Security in the initial Java release.</I> Classes designated 
          dangerous know hot wo query the Java Security Manager when called. The 
          Security Manager examines the stack for that call; if any untrusted 
          class is in the calling stack, the call is disallowed.</FONT></FONT> 
          <HR>
        </TD></TR>
      <TR>
          <TD><IMG 
          src="images/fig1.bmp"></TD>
        </TR></TBODY></TABLE><p></P>
    <LI>The Security Manager reports to the dangerous class whether any 
    untrusted classes exist in the calling stack. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>If any class in the current calling stack is considered "untrusted," the 
    call to the dangerous class is disallowed and signals an exception. If not, 
    the call proceeds. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></OL>There are some limits to the flexibility and 
  extensibility of this model: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Both the dangerous class and the class attempting to call it must 
    already be loaded before the Security Manager is called. 
    <LI>To be considered "dangerous," a class must be coded as such by its 
    author. Every dangerous method in the dangerous class has to contain a call 
    to the Security Manager for verification. All such checking is done at 
    run-time, which creates significant execution overhead. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The Security Manager needs to be rewritten to accommodate any new 
    dangerous operations that are introduced; the new Security Manager then 
    needs to be distributed to everyone wishing to use these new operations. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>If a call to a dangerous class is made by an innocuous "trusted" class, 
    but that trusted class was called by an untrusted class, the call is still 
    disallowed. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The addition of digital signatures allows previously "untrusted" classes 
    to be considered "trusted" because they come signed by a reputable source. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>
  <H3>Security with EC's Trust Manager for Java 
  <HR>
  </H3>Javasoft has lately been speaking of sandboxing, and this seems to have 
  created a bit of confusion. Sandboxing is not a proposed alternative to the 
  above mechanisms, but a description of how they expect the above mechanisms to 
  be used. 
  <P>ECTM/J works by modifying the Java Class Loader which, like the Java 
  Security Manager, is a part of the Java runtime. Restricted classes are 
  defined by the user in policy certificates (described in the next section) 
  that specify any restrictions on importing those classes. 
  <OL>
    <LI>When an attempt is made to load a new class, the Class Loader invokes 
    the Trust Manager. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The Trust Manager examines the new class to see which classes in 
    imports. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The Trust Manager consults the policy in the TBF to see which classes 
    are restricted. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>If the new class contains references to restricted classes, the Trust 
    Manager consults the certificate database for policy statements giving the 
    loading class permission to import the restricted class. These certificates 
    must in turn by authorized by policy statements in the TBF concerning them, 
    or by other certificates whose authorization then needs to be checked. This 
    can be an iterative process; the claim is traced back to the TBF through any 
    number of certificates found in the database or through hints leading to 
    other URLs. 
    <P>&nbsp;

          <I>Secrity with EC's Trust Manager for Java.</I> The system's Trust 
          Boot File (TBF) outlines policy specifying which classes are 
          restricted and under what circumstances they are allowed to be 
          imported. At load time, every class is checked by the Trust Manager 
          for imports of any restricted classes. If there are none, the class is 
          loaded and is free to execute. If the class does import restricted 
          classes, certificates are then checked to see if any chain authorizes 
          that class to import the restricted class. If not, the load of the 
          importing class fails.</FONT></FONT>

    <LI>If the class has been granted all the powers it needs to import the 
    classes it needs, it is allowed to load and run. If not, the load is 
    disallowed and an exception is signaled. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></OL>This capability infrastructure lets the outside world 
  access restricted classes via "safe" intermediary classes that present only a 
  subset of its functions. For example, the<I> File </I>class could be "wrapped" 
  by a class that uses<I> File </I>only to create a single temporary file of 
  limited length. This latter class, associated with a signed statement, can be 
  presented freely to the outside world because there's no way an abnormal or 
  hostile class could use it to do damage.

        <TT>EvilNasty</TT> class, because there's no way to use it to get at the

  <H2>The Structure of Policy</H2>System policy is based on a file on the user's 
  hard disk called the Trust Boot File (TBF). The Trust Boot File contains 
  certificates that grant powers to classes or signature public keys. The 
  signature public keys represent others such as a company MIS department, Java 
  class vendor, or network system administrator, to whom the user might delegate 
  certification authority. <BR>Certificates make assertions of the following 
  forms: 
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>Class <TT>PrefsFile</TT> is allowed to import class <TT>File</TT>. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Key <I>Donald</I> can authorize classes to import class <TT>File</TT>. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Key <I>Mary</I> can authorize classes to subclass class <TT>File</TT>. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Key <I>Donald</I> can authorize others to in turn authorize classes to 
    import class <TT>File</TT>. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Class <TT>PrefsFile</TT> belongs to package <TT>foo.bar.baz</TT>. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>Certificates in the Trust Boot File are administered by 
  the user with an interactive tool called the Policy Blesser. The Trust Boot 
  File contains the minimum number of trusted public keys and certificates 
  needed to bootstrap the certification process. It also contains "hints", which 
  are URLs telling the Trust Manager where to find additional certificates on 
  the network. For example, the TBF might contain the public key for the 
  company's MIS department, and the URL for obtaining the company's policy 
  certificates from the MIS department's server. These external certificates 
  must be signed by the key contained in the TBF to be accepted as valid. Keys 
  provided in those verified certificates can then be used in turn to locate and 
  verify additional trusted public keys. 
  <P>EC's Trust Manager for Java simplifies security concerns for the user by 
  enabling delegation of trust. A corporate user can specify in the Trust Boot 
  File that any certificate signed by the public key of the company's MIS 
  department is to be trusted. The MIS department can further delegate some of 
  that trust to the public keys of Sun, Microsoft, or other vendors of Java 
  classes. <BR>&nbsp;

  <H2>Benefits of ECTM/J</H2>The EC Trust Manager for Java has a number of 
  beneficial features: 
  <P> 
  <UL>
    <LI>Our Trust Manager and Loader judge the safety of a class <I>before</I> 
    it is loaded, unlike the existing Java Security Manager. Since checking is 
    at load time rather than runtime, security overhead is significantly 
    reduced. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>The modifications made to the source file <TT>classloader.c</TT>in the 
    Java runtime are minimal. You only need to add the hooks which invoke 
    certificate checking before loading a class. It will not be difficult for 
    any Java implementer to modify their classloader to utilize ECTM/J, making 
    integration cheap and easy. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Rather than making assumptions about the trustworthiness of a class 
    based on whether it came from the user's hard disk or over the network, 
    ECTM/J only cares about what signed certificates grant what powers to the 
    file. This enables faster and more convenient updates for published classes 
    and tighter security for classes obtained by means other than the network. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>EC's Trust Manager for Java provides decentralized checking and 
    verification instead of centralizing checking in the restricted class. There 
    is no requirement that the creator of a restricted class recognize it as 
    dangerous and code in calls to the Java Security Manager. Using ECTM/J, the 
    user can "redeclare" a class as restricted without the author of the class 
    having to rewrite it. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI>Vendors of Java classes can distribute these classes via insecure 
    channels without fear of their being replaced or corrupted. ECTM/J's 
    package-membership certification provides authentication equivalent to 
    signed classes as well as the certificates governing the use of those 
    classes. 
    <P>&nbsp;</P></LI></UL>
  <H2>A Word About E</H2>Electric Communities' Trust Manager for Java can be 
  incorporated easily and cheaply into any licensed Java implementation with a 
  minimum of modifications to the Java runtime. However, it was originally 
  developed as part of the E programming language. 
  <P>E is an object-oriented programming language designed for writing 
  distributed applications including databases, groupware, publishing systems, 
  multimedia, and games. E is a superset of Sun Microsystems' Java and builds 
  upon the Java Virtual Machine. E classes are very similar to Java classes, and 
  the two can coexist in the same program. However, an E-object responds only to 
  <I>messages</I> sent by other objects, rather than using the traditional 
  call/return semantics of Java methods. When an E-object receives a message, it 
  executes an associated E-method that defines what to do when the class 
  receives that message. 
  <P>E provides some powerful enhancements to Java, including: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Distributed communication.</B> E features a built-in model for remote 
    object communications, allowing an object to send messages directly to 
    objects that exist in other machines. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Capability semantics.</B> E offers a sophisticated security model 
    that allows convenient but extremely detailed control over sensitive 
    functions within a single machine or across a network. 
    <P> </P>
    <LI><B>Optimistic computation.</B> E implements a powerful method for 
    reducing the effect of communications latency in distributed systems.
