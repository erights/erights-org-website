<H2>Prologue</H2>

<P>The factorial function is a special case of Pochhammer's
polynomial and of the gamma function (aka Euler's integral of the
second kind). The conventional mathematical notation for the
factorial of <I>n</I> is

<P><CENTER><I>n</I>!</CENTER>

<P>so statements containing a factorial expression always look
surprising or important.

<P>The factorial function is used in the study of permutations. For
example, the number of possible sequences of a deck of 52 cards is
52! which is a really huge 68-digit number. To graph the factorial
function, start with your pencil at (1,1) moving northeast, then real
sudden-like, go north. The factorial function is explosive: the
largest factorial that can fit in a Java int is 12!.

<P>The most important application of the factorial function is a
pedagogical one: it is one of the classic exercises in first semester
programming. It is often one of the first examples presented of
iteration or recursion. It produces precise results, so it is easy to
verify. It is an integer function, so most number theory issues can
be avoided.

<P>Part of mastery of E is knowing when to use the optimistic
computation features of E, and when to use the pessimistic
computation features of Java. The factorial function does not benefit
from an optimistic implementation, and so should not be written in E.
It can be implemented more efficiently in Java. There are many
applications that benefit significantly from E's optimistic
computation features. The factorial function is not one of them.

<P>We will now present six implementations of the factorial function,
all written in E.

<P>All of the implementations of Factorial below can be called with
this sequence:

<PRE>    EInteger result;
    new Factorial &lt;- factorial (n, &amp;result);
    ewhen result (int fac) {
        // fac contains n! 
    }
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>result is an EInteger which will receive the result. The
distributor of result is sent to the Factorial eobject. When the
result has been computed, its value will be assigned to fac.

<P>The examples are presented in order of decreasing practicality.

<H2>Act One</H2>

<P>We will first examine three mostly-Java implementations. The first
one is very efficient, the remaining two are instructive. All three
are Java functions in E wrappers. This use of E can be beneficial in
the case where there is a math server available that could compute
the function while the requester goes on doing other useful work.

<P>If the goal is to compute the factorial function quickly, then the
best method is a table look up. The table doesn't even need to be
very large. This form of the factorial function is rarely seen in
programming texts, because the purpose of the factorial function in
general is didactic, not mathematical.

<PRE>// Act 1a: E wrapper table look up 
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial {  
    final static int factorialTable [ ] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 
            5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600};
&nbsp;
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (factorialTable [n]));
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The next example uses iteration to produce the product of all of
the counting numbers up to n. This is textbook stuff.

<PRE>// Act 1b: E wrapper iteration
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial {  
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        int product = 1;
        while (n &gt; 1) {
            product *= n;
            n -= 1;
        }
        result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (product));
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>The other classic textbook implementation of the factorial
function demonstrates recursion, defining a function in terms of
itself. This version makes use of a private Java method within an E
class.

<PRE>// Act 1c: E wrapper recursion 
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial {  
    private int factorialStep (int n) {
        if (n &gt; 1) {
            return (n * factorialStep (n - 1));
        } else {
            return (1);
        }
    }
&nbsp;
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (factorialStep (n));
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<H2>Act Two</H2>

<P>The three remaining implementations of the factorial function make
more extensive (if inappropriate) use of E's messaging semantics.

<P>The first implementation uses the message sending semantics of E
to perform iteration without using a loop. It iterates by sending
factorialStep messages (containing a decreasing n and an increasing
product) to itself. When n goes down to one, the product is forwarded
to the result.

<PRE>// Act 2a: message iteration (eteration) 
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial { 
    emethod factorialStep (int n, int product, EDistributor result) {
        if (n &gt; 1) {
            this &lt;- factorialStep (n - 1, n * product, result);
        } else {
            result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (product));
        }
    }
&nbsp;
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        this &lt;- factorialStep (n, 1, result);
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>This next implementation performs recursion without using a stack.
A chain of linked intermediate results will trigger a cascade of
ewhens which will produce the result.

<PRE>// Act 2b: message recursion (ecursion) 
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial {  
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        if (n &gt; 1) {
            EInteger intermediate;
            this &lt;- factorial (n - 1, &amp;intermediate);
            ewhen intermediate (int product) {
                result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (n * product));
            }
        } else {
            result &lt;- forward (new EInteger (1));
        }
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>Finally, we show a factorial function implementation using a pure
data flow computation model. All of the computation is expressed in
the form of messages.

<PRE>// Act 2c: dataflow 
&nbsp;
eclass Factorial {  
    final static EInteger EOne = new EInteger (1);
&nbsp;
    emethod factorialStep (EInteger n, EInteger product,
            EDistributor result) {
&nbsp;
        EBoolean nGreaterThanOne;
&nbsp;
        n &lt;- gt (EOne, &amp;nGreaterThanOne);
&nbsp;
        eif (nGreaterThanOne) {
            EInteger nMinusOne;
            EInteger nTimesProduct;
&nbsp;
            n &lt;- sub (EOne, &amp;nMinusOne);
            n &lt;- mul (product, &amp;nTimesProduct);
&nbsp;
            this &lt;- factorialStep (nMinusOne, nTimesProduct, result);
        } else {
            result &lt;- forward (product);
        }
    }
&nbsp;
    emethod factorial (int n, EDistributor result) {
        this &lt;- factorialStep (new EInteger (n), EOne, result);
    }
}
&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>This implements the same algorthm as the message iteration (2a)
example above. The difference is that every statement is an E
statement and every object is an EObject. So, for example, instead of
sending (n-1) in factorialStep, it sends a channel (nMinusOne) that
will eventually point an EObject having that value. This style of
dataflow programming can be quite effective in highly distributed or
massively parallel environments.
