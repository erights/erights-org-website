you send messages to remote objects without having to code any underlying
networking protocols. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>distributed garbage collector </P>

<P><A NAME="447128"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Unlike Java's garbage collector, which performs garbage collection only
within the scope of your local machine, E's distributed garbage collector
performs garbage collection over the net for your distributed objects.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>distributor </P>

<P><A NAME="446710"></A></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>E-interface </P>

<P><A NAME="446948"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similar to a regular Java interface, except that it describes E-methods
instead of regular Java methods. You designate an E-interface with the
<TT>einterface</TT> keyword. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>E-exception </P>

<P><A NAME="446849"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An exception thrown by <TT>ethrow</TT> and caught by <TT>ecatch</TT>
blocks. Unlike Java exceptions, an E exception does not encapsulate a back
stack trace. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>E-method </P>

<P><A NAME="446965"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A block of code that is invoked when an E-object receives a corresponding
message with that E-method name. An E-class must have an <TT>emethod</TT>
declaration for each message it can receive. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>EARL (E Absolute Reference Locator) </P>

<P><A NAME="446841"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The E equivalent to a Universal Resource Locator (URL), referencing
an E-object. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>E-classes </P>

<P><A NAME="447568"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The classes E provides to implement E functionality such as messaging
and security capabilities. They are interoperable with Java classes and
can contain both E and Java methods internally. Many of these are similar
to Java classes. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ecomp (E compiler) </P>

<P><A NAME="447354"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The name of the E runtime compiler. The <TT>ecomp</TT> compiler compiles
both Java and E code directly to Java bytecodes (<TT>.class</TT> files).
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>eif </P>

<P><A NAME="447516"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similar to the Java <TT>if</TT> statement, handling conditional execution
clauses. However, it uses optimistic computation to determine the condition.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>E-object </P>

<P><A NAME="447543"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similar to a Java object, but is derived from EObject, rather than Java's
Object class. An E-object implements E functionality such as messaging
and security capabilities. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>eforall </P>

<P><A NAME="446990"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An alternative to an <TT>emethod</TT> declaration. It receives all messages
sent to instances of its class, but it is given these messages in sealed
envelopes which it cannot open, since it lacks unsealers. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>envelope </P>

<P><A NAME="447562"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Encapsulates the parameters of a message and ensures that they can only
be read by a recipient E-object with the correct unsealer. The message
in the envelope is secured by the unforgeable sealer and unsealer associated
with it. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>eorif </P>

<P><A NAME="913260"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A clause of the <TT>eif</TT> statement. An <TT>eif</TT> statement containing
one or more <TT>eorif</TT> clauses is called a multiway-guarded <TT>eif</TT>
statement. A multiway guarded <TT>eif</TT> handles conditional cases that
are evaluated concurrently, such as timeouts. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>eorwhen </P>

<P><A NAME="447100"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A clause of the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. An <TT>ewhen</TT> statement
contains one or more <TT>eorwhen</TT> clauses, it is called a multiway
guarded <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. This means that the expression associated
with the <TT>ewhen</TT> code block and the various alternate expressions
associated with the other <TT>eorwhen</TT> code blocks are evaluated concurrently.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ethrow </P>

<P><A NAME="447044"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similar to Java's <TT>throw</TT> statement, except that it throws an
E-exception. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>etry </P>

<P><A NAME="447056"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Similar to Java's <TT>try</TT> statement, but contains one or more <TT>ecatch</TT>
clauses that receive E-exceptions and determine what to do with them. These
<TT>ecatch</TT> clauses collectively establish a new E-exception handling
environment for the execution of the <TT>etry</TT> code block. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ewhen </P>

<P><A NAME="446682"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Defers execution of its associated block of code until a value is furnished
for an E-object. The rest of your program can continue executing <I>optimistically</I>,
as if it already has the result(s) it is expecting. </P>

<P>You can use ewhen to get values or data from an E-object. For example,
you can use <TT>ewhen</TT> to get a Java integer value from an <I>EInteger</I>
object, and add this value to another Java integer. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ewhenever </P>

<P><A NAME="447123"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An <TT>ewhen</TT> statement that executes its code block every time
it receives a value for its argument. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>forward </P>

<P><A NAME="446788"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A message that provides a channel's distributor with a destination.
When a channel is forwarded, all messages sent to that channel are delivered
to the E-object that the channel is forwarded to. You can even send messages
to an unforwarded channel; these messages will be delivered later when
the channel is eventually forwarded. </P>

<P>You can forward a channel to many recipients; all messages sent through
that channel will be received by all the recipients. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>key </P>

<P><A NAME="447273"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A string of bits used in E's public-key cryptographical authentication
mechanism. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>javaec (E Java interpreter) </P>

<P><A NAME="447369"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The E Java interpreter that interprets and executes Java bytecodes generated
by the compiler. The <TT>javaec</TT> interpreter is based on Java's interpreter,
<TT>java</TT>, but includes E features such as the Distributed Garbage
Collector and Trust Manager. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>launch </P>

<P><A NAME="913275"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The means of giving an E-object access to the E Environment facilities.
An object is launched through <I>RtLauncher</I>'s <TT>launch</TT> method,
which creates a general environment object. From this trusted object, you
can create a more specified, restricted environment and pass this to another
object. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>mailing timeout </P>

<P><A NAME="913277"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In E, these occur when the system cannot successfully deliver a message
to the recipient object within a predefined time period. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>message </P>

<P><A NAME="446661"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>E-objects only respond to messages, rather than the call/return semantics
of Java. A message consists of the name of an E-method to be executed by
the recipient E-object, an envelope encapsulating the message parameters,
and a sealer. The recipient E-object responds to the message by executing
that specified E-method. In E, messaging is asynchronous and unidirectional.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>optimistic computation </P>

<P><A NAME="446061"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A method of preventing long delays when communicating across a network.
It lets objects send messages and continue execution of the rest of the
code without waiting for a reply. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>persistent object storage </P>

<P><A NAME="447154"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A means of storing your objects to a an object database, and later retrieving
them to use in other applications. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>POLICY statement </P>

<P><A NAME="447315"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In a Trust Boot File, these are the axioms of a system of statements
about trust. These axioms are used to generate theorems about the trustworthiness
of other certificates, entities, keys, classes, and packages. Only classes
whose trustworthiness is logically demonstrable within this system will
be loaded and executed. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>public key cryptography (PKC) </P>

<P><A NAME="447253"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A mathematical technology enabling private communication of data over
public channels (even when the parties involved are not previously known
to each other) and unforgeable digital signatures that can be used to conclusively
prove the origin of a message. </P>

<P>In public-key cryptography, instead of a single secret key, one uses
a pair of complementary keys, each of which can unscramble messages scrambled
with the other. However, because of the mathematics underlying PKC, knowing
one key of the pair does not make it practical to guess or calculate the
other. A PKC user can make one key of the pair his <I>public key</I>, known
to the world, and keep the other as his <I>private key.</I> </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>registrar </P>

<P><A NAME="447222"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An E environment object that encapsulates the right to register objects
by name in the local machine's object directory. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>response timeout </P>

<P><A NAME="447147"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In E, these occur when a message is successfully delivered to an object,
but the receiving E-method does not respond in a timely fashion. Since
E's messaging model is asynchronous, this is a legitimate situation; there
is no way for a sending E-method to know when its requests will be serviced.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>parent database </P>

<P><A NAME="447190"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An object database that is referred to indirectly by another (child)
object database. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>root key </P>

<P><A NAME="447181"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A name you can specify for a stream key when you save it to the database.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>sealer </P>

<P><A NAME="446812"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An object representing the right to send a message to another E-object.
A sealer seals an envelope encapsulating the parameters of a message, and
ensures that this message can only be read by an object with the appropriate
unsealer. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>secret key cryptography </P>

<P><A NAME="913285"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The conventional cryptographical technology. The security of secret-key
cryptography relies on the secrecy of a key, or string of bits, used according
to a specified recipe or algorithm to scramble the message being sent.
Anyone who knows both the key and the algorithm can unscramble the message
and retrieve the original (or plaintext) message. The secret key must be
passed from one participant to the other, in some way immune to eavesdropping,
before they can communicate. See also <I>public key cryptography.</I> </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>signatures </P>

<P><A NAME="446238"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>See <I>Digital signature.</I> </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>source claim statement </P>

<P><A NAME="447327"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In a certificate, these statements assert a rule for deciding the trustworthiness
of keys, classes, or packages. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>stream key </P>

<P><A NAME="447170"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A token received when your application makes a request to store an object
in the persistent object database. Your E program can then later redeem
this stream key for the object. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>trust boot file (TBF) </P>

<P><A NAME="447295"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A file containing an initial set of statements regarding which users
or code sources can be trusted, to what extent, and in what contexts. The
file also contains information on whether these trusted authorities may
delegate trust, in the form of <I>capabilities, </I>to other entities.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Trust Manager </P>

<P><A NAME="447344"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>E's authentication mechanism that verifies the authorship and integrity
of E classes and packages. This mechanism includes the concept of sealers/unsealers,
the Trust Boot File, certificates, and the Class Blesser. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>unsealer </P>

<P><A NAME="446829"></A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>An object representing the right to receive and open a message sealed
by another object. Only an E-object with the correct unsealer can read
a message sealed by another E-object. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
