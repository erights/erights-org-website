<H1>The E Language Specification</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This chapter describes the E language specification. Generally, E follows
Java's language specifications, plus some additions.</P>

<P> <B>Additional functionality for Java keywords.</B> In E, you use regular
Java statements such as <TT>implements</TT> and <TT>imports</TT>. Generally,
the behavior of these keywords is the same as in Java.</P>

<P> The <TT>import</TT> statement has some additional functionality when
used in E, in that it also imports the sealers (as well as the related
classes and methods) for the messages in the E-classes and E-interfaces.</P>

<P> <B>E reserved words. </B>Besides the regular Java reserved words, the
E runtime has its own <A HREF="#reserved">reserved words.</A></P>

<P> <B>E language elements.</B> E also provides language elements that
support the E runtime:</P>

<P><TT><I>recipientEobject</I> &lt;- <I>messageName</I> (<I>messageParameterList</I>);
</TT></P>

<P>The send operator (<TT>&lt;-)</TT>, is the operator that sends E messages
to an E-object. The <I>messageName</I> and <I>messageParameterList</I>
take the same form as they do in a regular Java method call. </P>

<P>The <I>recipientEobject</I> denotes the E-object to which the message
should be sent. This can be an E-object proper or a channel. If you already
have a sealed message encapsulated in an envelope (that is, in an object
of class <I>RtEnvelope</I>), you can send it with an expression of the
form:</P>

<P> <TT>recipientEobject &lt;- envelopeExpression; </TT></P>

<P>where <I>envelopeExpression</I> is an expression whose result is the
envelope you wish to send.</P>

<P> Alternatively, the recipient can be a variable of class <I>RtEnvelope.
</I>In this case, the message is simply sealed in a new envelope which
is stored in the variable, but is not sent anywhere.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Examples</H2>

<P>Send a message <TT>myMessage</TT> to an E-object called <TT>otherGuy</TT>.</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>otherGuy &lt;- myMessage ();</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The E-object <TT>otherGuy</TT> has a corresponding E-method called <TT>myMessage</TT>,
which it executes when it receives the message.</P>

<H1><A NAME="dist"></A>&amp; (distributor operator) </H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>&amp; </TT><I>channelName</I>
</PRE>

<P>The distributor operator (the ampersand symbol) obtains a channel variable's
distributor (in order to send it a <TT>forward</TT> message, for example).
The result is of class <I>EDistributor</I> and you can treat it as a normal
value; for example, you can pass it as a message parameter.</P>

<P> You can only use this operator within the scope of the channel's initial
declaration. You cannot use this operator on a channel which has been passed
as the parameter of an E message or Java method call, or stored as an instance
variable of an object other than that object itself.</P>

<P> All variables whose class is <I>EObject</I> (or a subclass of <I>EObject</I>)
that have not been explicitly initialized in their declaration are implicitly
initialized to a new instance of <I>EChannel</I>. Such channels are initially
unforwarded (that is, they have not yet been given a destination E-object.
See the <TT>forward</TT> statement later in this chapter for more information).
</P>

<P>To forward a channel, send the <TT>forward</TT> message to the channel's
associated distributor, including the destination E-object as a message
parameter (see the following example).</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Example </H2>

<PRE><TT>&amp;sparkPlug &lt;- forward(spark);</TT>
</PRE>

<P>This example extracts the distributor for the channel <TT>sparkPlug,</TT>
and sends the distributor a message forwarding it to <TT>spark</TT>.</P>

<H1><A NAME="eclass"></A>eclass </H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT><I>modifier*</I> eclass <I>newEClassName 
</I>  [ extends<I> superEclassName </I>]
<I>  </I>[ implements <I>interfaceList </I>]
  { <I>eclassBody</I> }</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>eclass</TT> statement defines a new E-class, and is similar
to Java's <TT>class</TT> statement. </P>

<P>An E-class can implement message protocols (called E-interfaces in this
manual) as well as regular Java interfaces. You designate an E-interface
with the <TT>einterface</TT> keyword. The optional <I>interfaceList</I>
is a comma-separated list of interface and E-interface names.</P>

<P> An E-class can only extend another E-class. If it is not explicitly
declared to extend another E-class, its immediate superclass is <I>EObject</I>.
E-classes inherit E-interfaces, E-methods, regular Java methods, and instance
variables from their superclasses.</P>

<P> Instance variables and Java methods in an E-class cannot be declared
<TT>public</TT>; they can only be accessed from within the object itself.
All references to the instance variables or Java methods of an E-class
must be made relative to <TT>this</TT> or <TT>super</TT>, either explicitly
or implicitly. This is because the reference may actually lead to a remote
E-object in a different machine across a network connection; its instance
variables and Java methods will not be directly accessible, even though
you <I>can</I> send E-messages to it.</P>

<P> An <TT>eclass</TT> body can contain any of the statements allowed inside
regular Java <TT>class</TT> body. In addition, it can contain either E-methods
or an <TT>eforall</TT> declaration. These are described in the following
subsections. Both Java methods and E-methods can use the E deferring statements
(such as <TT>ewhen</TT> <TT>and</TT> <TT>ewhenever</TT>); these statements
are described later in this chapter.</P>

<P> An E-class can have either an <TT>eforall</TT> or an <TT>emethod</TT>
declaration; it cannot have both. However, it can still have Java methods
in either situation.</P>

<P> The <I>modifier</I>s are optional and can be either the <TT>public</TT>,
<TT>final</TT> or <TT>abstract</TT> Java modifiers.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Example</H2>

<PRE><TT>eclass EFileExampleLauncher implements ELaunchable
  {
    emethod go (RtEEnvironment env) {
   <I>  eclass body...}
  
</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="emethod"></A>emethod</H2>

<PRE><TT>emethod <I>methodName (parameterList) {
  methodBody}</I></TT>
</PRE>

<P>The<B> </B><TT>emethod</TT> declaration defines an E-method for an E-class.
An E-method is a block of code that is invoked when the E-object receives
a corresponding message with that E-method name. An E-class must have an
<TT>emethod</TT> declaration for each message it can receive. E-methods
and their corresponding messages are named within the scope of the containing
package (such as <TT>ec.e.run</TT>).</P>

<P> An E-method message parameter is typed in the same manner as a Java
method parameter. The <I>parameterList</I> consists of a series of comma-separated
entries of the form:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>  <I>parameterType parameterName</I></TT></PRE>

<P>The body of the E-method follows the same format as a Java method body.
Note that no return type is declared-since E-message sends are one-way,
there is no return value. Also, since E-methods are not &quot;called&quot;
by objects, they do not have access specifiers such as <TT>public</TT>
or <TT>protected</TT>.</P>

<P> Java classes cannot contain E-methods, though they can send messages
to E-objects.</P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<PRE><TT>emethod DieRollEWhen(
  EInteger HisResult, EInteger HisKey, 
  EDistributor MyResult, EDistributor MyKey)
{
<I>  DieRollEWhen code body

</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="eforall"></A>eforall</H2>

<PRE><TT>eforall (<I>parameter
</I>) {
  <I>methodBody

</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>eforall</TT> declaration is an alternative to an <TT>emethod</TT>
declaration. It receives all messages sent to instances of its class, but
it is given these messages in sealed envelopes which it cannot open, since
it lacks unsealers. </P>

<P>An <TT>eforall</TT> statement has a single parameter which must be of
class <I>RtEnvelope</I>; this parameter contains the sealed message. Although
the method cannot open the envelope, it <I>can</I> send it to other E-objects.
You can use this feature to implement message &quot;plumbing&quot; of various
sorts, such as forwarders, redirectors, and loggers.</P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Example</H4>

<P>This example sends a message to an E-object <TT>newMiddleman</TT> containing
an <TT>eforall</TT>. The <TT>eforall</TT> logs the message and then sends
the sealed message on to another destination (<TT>theRealDestination</TT>)
without ever &quot;opening&quot; it.</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>public eclass EMessagesender {
  EMiddleman newMiddleman = new EMiddleman();
  ....
  distributionList&lt;-forward(newMiddleman);
  .....
}

eclass EMiddleman {
  eforall (RtEnvelope msg) {
    <I>logMessage</I>(msg);
    theRealDestination &lt;- msg;
  }

<PRE><TT>eif (<I>condition</I>) {

</I>} [ eorif ( <I>alternativeCondition</I> ) {
  <I>eorifBlock
</I>} ]* [ else {
  <I>elseBlock
</I>} ]</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>eif</TT> statement is similar to the Java <TT>if</TT> statement,
and handles conditional execution clauses. However, it uses optimistic
computation to determine the <I>condition</I>. This <I>condition</I> must
be an <I>EBoolean</I>, though it can actually be a channel to an <I>EBoolean</I>
whose value is undetermined at the time the <TT>eif</TT> statement is initially
executed. </P>

<P>The <TT>eif</TT> statement is part of a special group of E statements
that defer code execution until a value is furnished for a variable. These
statements include <TT>eif</TT>, <TT>ewhen</TT>, <TT>ewhenever</TT>, and
the <TT>ecatch</TT> portion of <TT>etry</TT>. These statements are described
elsewhere in this chapter.</P>

<P> All other non-deferring statements in the code block which contains
the <TT>eif</TT> statement (including statements which follow the <TT>eif</TT>
in the source text), execute before the code blocks associated with the
<TT>eif</TT>, regardless of when the value of <I>condition</I> is furnished.
</P>

<P>An <TT>eif</TT> statement defers execution of its associated code blocks
until <I>condition</I> furnishes a value. If there are no <TT>eorif</TT>
clauses (documented in the following subsection), and <I>condition</I>
is <TT>etrue</TT>, <I>thenBlock</I> executes. If <I>condition</I> is <TT>efalse</TT>,
the <I>elseBlock</I> executes (if there is one). If no <I>EBoolean</I>
is furnished for <I>condition</I>, neither block executes.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>Using eif with Java code</H3>

<P>An <TT>eif</TT> statement can only be used inside an E-class, although
it does not need to exist inside an E-method. Note, however, that if you
use <TT>eif</TT> inside a regular Java method, you cannot return a value
for that method from within the <TT>eif</TT> statement. This is because
the Java method will actually have returned before any of the blocks associated
with the <TT>eif</TT> gets executed. You <I>can</I> use a <TT>return</TT>
statement (without a return value) inside an <TT>eif</TT> to exit the <TT>eif</TT>
conditional block.</P>

<P> An <TT>eif</TT> statement can produce results different from Java's
<TT>if</TT> statement, even though the code may appear logically the same.
See the example at the end of this section for more information. </P>

<H3><A NAME="eorif"></A>Multiway-guarded eif statement</H3>

<P>If the <TT>eif</TT> statement contains one or more <TT>eorif</TT> clauses,
it becomes a multiway guarded <TT>eif</TT> statement. A multiway <TT>eif</TT>
handles conditional cases that are evaluated concurrently, such as timeouts.
This construct consists of an <TT>eif</TT> clause, followed by one or more
<TT>eorif</TT> clauses and an optional <TT>else</TT> clause:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>eif ( <I>condition
</I> ) {
<I>  thenBlock
</I>} [ eorif ( <I>alternativeCondition
</I> ) {
<I>  eorifBlock
</I>} ]* [ else {
<I>  elseBlock
</I>} ]</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The <I>condition</I> associated with <I>thenBlock</I> and the various
<I>alternativeConditions</I> associated with the <I>eorifBlock</I>s are
evaluated concurrently. The first to result in <TT>etrue</TT> has its associated
code block executed and prevents all the other code blocks from executing.
The <I>elseBlock</I> executes only if all the conditions result in <TT>efalse</TT>.
</P>

<P>In a multiway-guarded <TT>eif</TT>, only one block will ever execute,
though none of them will if none of the conditions furnishes a value.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Examples</H2>

<PRE><TT>eif (Win) {
  <I>WinnerCode

</I>} else {
  <I>LoserCode

</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>In this example, <I>WinnerCode</I> executes if the value produced from
<TT>Win</TT> is true. <I>LoserCode</I> executes if the value is false.
Neither code block executes if there is no value.</P>

<P>The <TT>ethrow</TT> statement is similar to Java's <TT>throw</TT> statement,
except that it throws an E-exception. <I>expression</I> is the E-exception
that is thrown. See the information on the <TT>etry</TT> statement for
a more detailed discussion of E's exception handling mechanism.</P>

  <I>ecatchcodeBlock
</I>} ]<I>+
</I> </TT>
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>etry</TT> statement is similar to Java's <TT>try</TT> statement.
It contains one or more <TT>ecatch</TT> clauses that receive E-exceptions
and determine what to do with them. These <TT>ecatch</TT> clauses collectively
establish a new E-exception handling environment for the execution of <I>trycodeBlock</I>.
Any E-exceptions which are thrown by executing <I>trycodeBlock</I> are
caught here, except those that are caught inside another <TT>etry</TT>
statement. </P>

<P>Just as the Java exception handling environment follows the flow of
method call and return, the E-exception handling environment follows the
flow of message sends. However, because E-message sends are one-way operations
and E-method invocations are asynchronous, the behavior of E's exception
mechanism differs significantly from Java's.</P>

<P> The exception handling environment established by an <TT>etry</TT>
statement accompanies any messages sent by <I>trycodeBlock</I> into the
E-methods that process those messages. It will continue to accompany any
messages those E-methods send in turn, unless they establish new E-exception
environments with <TT>etry</TT> statements of their own.</P>

<P> An E-exception environment persists until all messages within it have
been processed, including any messages spawned by remote objects in response
to messages received from the current environment. In other words, an E-exception
handling environment is responsible for all computation initiated within
its scope, even if remote objects are doing the computing.</P>

<P> Any time an E-exception is thrown (via the <TT>ethrow</TT> statement),
the exception is caught by whatever E-exception handling environment is
current for the E-method that is executing.</P>

<P> All other non-deferring statements in the code block which contains
the <TT>etry</TT>, including statements which follow the <TT>etry</TT>
in the source text, execute before the code blocks associated with the
ecatc<TT>h</TT> clauses, regardless of when any E-exception is thrown as
a result of <I>trycodeBlock</I>. </P>

<P>Unlike Java's <TT>try</TT> statement, the <TT>etry</TT> statement cannot
have a <TT>finally</TT> clause. Also, E does not require your E-methods
to either catch or declare non-runtime E exceptions. Finally, E-exceptions
(which are of class <I>RtEException) </I>are based on the Java <I>RuntimeException</I>
class, not <I>Exception,</I> so they does not encapsulate a back stack
trace.</P>

<PRE><TT>ewhen <I>expression</I> ( <I>type valueName</I> ) {
<I>  block
</I>} [ eorwhen <I>alternateExpression</I> ( <I>type</I> <I>valueName</I> ) {
  <I>alternateBlock
</I>} ]<I>*</I></TT>

</PRE>

<P>An <TT>ewhen</TT> statement defers execution of the code it contains
until an actual value is furnished from an E-object. Though similar conceptually
to calling a Java method in that both obtain a value from an object, <TT>ewhen</TT>'s
implementation of optimistic programming make it unique to E; there is
nothing like it in Java. </P>

<P>Since E-methods and E-object cannot return values themselves, you can
use <TT>ewhen</TT> to get values or other data from other E-objects. This
value can be of any Java type. This means you can use <TT>ewhen</TT> to
obtain Java values from E-objects, and thus bridge your Java and E code.
For example, you can use <TT>ewhen</TT> to get a Java integer value from
an <I>EInteger</I> object, and add this value to another Java integer.
</P>

<P><I>expression</I> is an E-object, though this may actually be a channel
to an E-object whose value is undetermined at the time the <TT>ewhen</TT>
statement is initially executed. After this E-object furnishes a value,
the <TT>ewhen</TT> code block can execute.</P>

<P> <I>type valuename</I> is the type and name of the value furnished by
<I>expression</I>. Since E-objects cannot return their value like ordinary
objects, you include a value method in the E-object that lets it return
a Java type value. See the following section<I> Getting Java values from
E-objects with ewhen</I> for more information.</P>

<P> An <TT>ewhen</TT> can only be used inside an E-class, although it does
not need to exist inside an E-method. However, if you use <TT>ewhen</TT>
inside a regular Java method, you cannot return a value for that method
from within the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. This is because the Java method
will actually have returned before any of the blocks associated with the
<TT>ewhen</TT> gets executed. You <I>can</I> use a <TT>return</TT> statement
(without a return value) inside an <TT>ewhen</TT> to exit the <TT>ewhen</TT>
block.</P>

<P> <B>NOTE:</B> The <TT>ewhen</TT> statement executes <I>only the first
time</I> a value is furnished. To execute a block of code every time a
value is furnished, use <TT>ewhenever</TT>.</P>

<P> The <TT>ewhen</TT> statement is part of a special group of E statements
that defer code execution until a value is furnished for an E-object. These
statements include <TT>eif</TT>, <TT>ewhen</TT>, <TT>ewhenever</TT>, and
the <TT>ecatch</TT> portion of <TT>etry</TT>. </P>

<P>All other non-deferring statements in the code block which contains
the <TT>ewhen</TT> <TT>(</TT>including statements which follow the <TT>ewhen</TT>
in the source text) execute before the code blocks associated with the
<TT>ewhen</TT>, regardless of when the value of <I>expression</I> is produced.
</P>

<P>For an <TT>ewhen</TT> statement that contains no <TT>eorwhen</TT> clauses
(see the following paragraphs for information on <TT>eorwhen</TT>), when
<I>expression</I> reveals a value for <I>valueName</I> (which must be of
type <I>type</I>), <I>block</I> executes.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Getting Java values from E-objects</H2>

<P>An E-object responds to an <TT>ewhen</TT> statement by providing a value
for itself. However, an E-object cannot return its value like an ordinary
Java object. Instead, you include a method within the E-object to let it
furnish a Java type value.</P>

<P> To do this, you provide the E-object with a <TT>value</TT> method.
This is an ordinary zero-argument Java method which should return the E-object's
value. An E-object can return a value of any Java type. </P>

<P>For example, E's own <I>EInteger</I> class, which provides an optimistic
computation wrapper of an instance of Java <TT>int</TT>, has the following
value method:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>int value() { return(myValue); }</TT>
</PRE>

<P>(<TT>myValue</TT> is an instance variable of <I>EInteger</I> which contains
the <TT>int</TT> that the <I>EInteger</I> is wrapping).</P>

<P> To have an E-object to furnish a value, you must include this <TT>value</TT>
method in its class definition. Although the value method is not mandatory,
an <TT>ewhen</TT> statement cannot &quot;access&quot; an E-object that
does not have one.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Closures</H2>

<P>When your E program encounters a deferring statement like <TT>ewhen</TT>,
it takes a snapshot of all the referenced local variables and parameters
within the scope of that statement. This snapshot is called a <I>closure</I>.
E saves this closure for whenever the <TT>ewhen</TT> needs it; the <TT>ewhen</TT>
then uses the values in the closure when it executes. Each <TT>ewhen</TT>
gets its own closure. </P>

<H2><A NAME="eorwhen"></A>Multiway-guarded ewhen statement</H2>

<P>If the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement contains one or more <TT>eorwhen</TT>
clauses, it becomes a multiway guarded <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. This means
that the <I>expression</I> associated with <I>block</I> and the various
<I>alternateExpressions</I> associated with the <I>alternateBlocks</I>
are evaluated concurrently. The multiway-guarded <TT>ewhen</TT> construct
consists of an <TT>ewhen</TT> clause followed by one or more <TT>eorwhen</TT>
clauses:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>ewhen <I>expression
</I> ( type <I>valueName
</I> ) {
<I>  block
</I>} [ eorwhen <I>alternateExpression
</I> ( type <I>valueName
</I> ) {
<I>  alternateBlock
</I>} ]*</TT>
</PRE>

<P>The first code block that is furnished a result has its associated code
block executed and prevents all the other code blocks from executing. Only
one block ever executes. If no values are furnished for any of the expressions,
none of the code blocks execute.</P>

<P> </P>

<H2>Examples</H2>

<PRE><TT>emethod BakeCake (parameters) {
  <I>Code1

</I>  ewhen Bob (int SomeNumber)   {
    <I>SomeEwhenCode

</I>  }
  ewhen Sue (int OtherNumber) {
    <I>OtherEwhenCode

</I>  }
  <I>Code2

</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>In this example, <I>Code1</I> and <I>Code2</I> do not contain any <TT>ewhen</TT>,
<TT>eif</TT> or <TT>etry</TT> statements. Computation proceeds in the following
order:</P>

<P> </P>

<OL>
<LI><I>Code1</I> executes. </LI>

<LI>The two <TT>ewhen</TT> statements generate messages to obtain values
from <TT>Bob</TT> and <TT>Sue</TT>. At this time, <I>SomeEwhenCode</I>
and <I>OtherEwhenCode</I> do not execute, even if the requested values
are available immediately. Instead, computation continues with <I>Code2</I>.
</LI>

<LI><I>Code2</I> executes. </LI>

<LI>If <TT>Bob</TT> or <TT>Sue</TT> (or both) have furnished values for
<TT>SomeNumber</TT> or <TT>OtherNumber</TT>, respectively, <I>SomeEwhenCode</I>
or <I>OtherEwhenCode</I> can execute. The order of execution of <I>SomeEwhenCode</I>
and <I>OtherEwhenCode</I> depends solely upon which happens to obtain its
argument value first. </LI>
</OL>

<P>If an <TT>eorwhen</TT> clause had been used in place of the second <TT>ewhen</TT>
statement, the example would look like this:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>emethod BakeCake (parameters) {
  <I>Code1

</I>  ewhen Bob (int SomeNumber)   {
    <I>SomeEwhenCode

</I>  } eorwhen Sue (int OtherNumber) {
    <I>OtherEwhenCode

</I>  }
  <I>Code2

</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>In this case the interpretation is very similar to that of the first
example. However, if <TT>Bob</TT> reveals a value before <TT>Sue</TT> does,
then <I>SomeEwhenCode</I> will be executed but <I>OtherEwhenCode</I> never
will be. Conversely, if <TT>Sue</TT> is first to reveal a value, <I>OtherEwhenCode</I>
executes to the exclusion of <I>SomeEwhenCode</I>.</P>

<P> An <TT>ewhen</TT> statement defines the lexical environment of the
code associated with it, tying it to the value received for the argument.
The values of variables visible to the code inside the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement
is the same as if it that code had executed immediately. In either of the
above examples, the lexical environment of <I>SomeEwhenCode</I> includes
the value for <TT>SomeNumber</TT> received from <TT>Bob</TT> in the message
set up by the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. In addition, if <I>SomeEwhenCode</I>
and <I>OtherEwhenCode</I> use variables that are manipulated by both <I>Code1</I>
and <I>Code2</I>, they see only the results produced by <I>Code1</I>. </P>

<PRE><TT>ewhenever <I>expression</I> ( <I>type valueName</I> ) {
<I>  block
</I>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>An <TT>ewhenever</TT> statement is an <TT>ewhen</TT> statement which
executes its code block every time it receives a value for its argument.</P>

<P> Multiple executions occur when a channel is forwarded to multiple destinations,
all of which furnish values for the <TT>ewhenever</TT> argument. An <TT>ewhen</TT>
statement would execute <I>block</I> only once, the first time a value
is furnished for <I>expression</I>.</P>

<P> The other difference between <TT>ewhen</TT> and <TT>ewhenever</TT>
is that an <TT>ewhenever</TT> statement may not have any <TT>eorwhen</TT>
clauses, since the mutual exclusion which <TT>eorwhen</TT> implies does
not really make sense in the context of a statement which executes multiple
times.</P>

<P> See the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement documentation for complete information
about order of code execution, the lexical environment of <I>block</I>
and so forth. </P>

<P>Like an <TT>ewhen</TT>, an <TT>ewheneve</TT>r gets a snapshot of all
its variables called a closure. However, an <TT>ewhenever</TT>'s execution
operates on a copy of this closure, not the actual closure itself. This
ensures that the closure retains its original values for the next <TT>ewhenever</TT>
execution. If your <TT>ewhenever</TT> statement modifies any of the values
in the closure, those new values are not retained. </P>

<P>Be aware, however, that if your deferring statement references Java
objects, the closure captures the reference to that object, not the value
of the object itself. If your program subsequently modifies the object,
the closure will reference that modified object, and the next <TT>ewhenever</TT>
will execute using the new value.</P>

<H1><A NAME="forward"></A>forward </H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><TT><I>distributor</I> &lt;- forward( <I>destinationEObject ); </I></TT></P>

<P>The <TT>forward</TT> message provides a channel's distributor with a
destination. Once you have forwarded a channel, you cannot unforward it,
though you may forward a channel more than once. </P>

<P>A channel itself is an E-object, derived from class <I>EChannel</I>
(or one of its subclasses). In E, all E-object variables that are not explicitly
initialized in their declarations are implicitly initialized to new instances
of <I>EChannel.</I> These channels are initially unforwarded.</P>

<P> Every channel has a <I>distributor</I>, which can be obtained from
the channel (in the channel's defining scope only) using the distributor
operator, &quot;<TT>&amp;</TT>&quot; (see the discussion of this operator
at the beginning of this chapter). The distributor is an E-object of class
<I>EDistributor</I>. To forward a channel, send a <TT>forward</TT> message
to the channel's distributor.</P>

<P> When a channel is forwarded to an E-object, all messages sent to that
channel are delivered to that E-object. You can even send messages to an
unforwarded channel; these messages will be delivered later when the channel
is eventually forwarded.</P>

<P> You can forward a channel to many recipients; all messages sent through
that channel will be received by all the recipients. Messaging is asynchronous:
when you forward a channel to a new recipient, it receives all the messages
that have ever been sent through that channel. </P>

<H2>Examples</H2>

<P>The most common usage would result from a message send something like
this:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>obj &lt;- req(<I>parameters</I>, &amp;someChannel);</TT></PRE>

<P>The receiving E-method would look like the following:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>req(<I>parameters</I>, Edistributor resultDist) {
  <I>...do some stuff...

</I>  resultDist &lt;- forward(someResultObject);
  </TT>...
<TT>}</TT>
</PRE>

<P>A less common case is something like:</P>

<P> </P>

<PRE><TT>&amp;someChannel &lt;- forward(someObject);</TT>
</PRE>

<P>This is used when you need to pass a channel to another object and want
to control where the messages that object sends to that channel will go.</P>
