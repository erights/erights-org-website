<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Welcome to the E Programmer's Manual. This manual is a conceptual guide
and reference for the E Language. For information on how to install, and
configure E, see the README.TXT file that is packaged with the E software.
</P>

<P>Select one of the following topics to access the E Programmer's Manual
documents. This manual is also available for downloading as a postscript
file.</P>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="Econcepts.html">Getting Started with E</A> </DT>

<DD>This chapter introduces the concepts essential to understanding the
E programming language. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="Runtime.html">The E Runtime</A> </DT>

<DD>This chapter discusses the concepts a programmer needs to understand
when developing an E application. The E runtime environment is similar
to the Java runtime environment; however, this chapter points out several
distinctions. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="LanguageSpec.html">E Language Specifications</A> </DT>

<DD>This is a reference to the syntax of the E Language. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="Classes.html">E Class Library</A> </DT>

<DD>This is a reference to the classes provided to support the E runtime.
</DD>

<DT><A HREF="Tools.html">E Tools and Utilities</A> </DT>

<DD>This chapter describes the tools and utilities provided to support
the E environment. </DD>
</DL>

  <P>There is also a <A HREF="../glossary.html">glossary</A> that lists and describes 
    E terms.</P>

<H3>Acknowledgements </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The E programming language was largely inspired by the language Joule,
currently being developed by Dean Tribble, Norm Hardy, and their colleagues
at Agorics, Inc. of Los Altos, California. Indeed, the fundamental idea
behind E was to take the core ideas from Joule and apply them to Java.
Our friends at Agorics have been generous advisors and invaluable teachers;
E would not have been possible without their support. </P>
