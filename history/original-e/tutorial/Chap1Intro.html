<H1>Introduction to E</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This section introduces you to E programming concepts. For more information,
refer to the E Programmer's Manual.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>E is a set of extensions to Java designed for writing distributed applications.
It enhances your Java code by offering security and communications extensions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>E enhances and improves your Java code in the following areas:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Security</LI>

<LI>Communication</LI>

<LI>Optimistic programming</LI>
</UL>

<P>These features mean that you will not have to work as hard to maintain
security and communication when designing networked applications. E does
it for you.</P>

<P>This tutorial introduces you to these concepts while you learn E. </P>

<H2>Security</H2>

<P>Java's security model is based on an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; approach:
it assumes that all code that originated on the local hard disk is trusted,
and all code that originated from the network is not trusted. This model
can be very secure, but it does have loopholes. For example, since local
code is &quot;trustworthy&quot;, it is given access to resources that it
may not need. This can increase the chances of viruses and trojan horses
infecting your machine. Also, Java does not allow you to assign access
selectively, on an as-needed basis. </P>

<P>E closes many of these security holes by letting you selectively assign
privileges. &quot;Trustedness&quot; is granted in as much or as little
detail as you choose. For example, you could deny your application the
ability to write anywhere in the file system, but allow it to add a limited
number of records to a database. Since you assign these privileges directly
in the application, they are preserved regardless of where the application
originates-whether on the network or on your local drive.</P>

<P>By creating a trusted object that implements limited capabilities, and
giving an untrusted object the ability to send messages to this new object,
you can obtain more functionality from the untrusted code without compromising
security. You also do not have to rely on third-party security mechanisms
to assign privileges for your application.</P>

<H2>Communication</H2>

<P>E features a built-in model for remote object communications. It lets
you automatically establish connections between objects without having
to deal directly with the underlying network protocols. This lets machines
talk directly, with messages directed only to specific objects. </P>

<P>Other languages can require a lot of effort to establish remote communications.
For example, Java requires many sockets to be built just to establish a
pipe between two machines, and the result is not as secure. In contrast,
E lets you do this easily with just a few keywords. </P>

<H2>Optimistic Computation</H2>

<P>All distributed systems experience the problems of deadlock and race
conditions. E resolves this by letting your program send a message and
still continue execution in other code blocks, letting that message's associated
code block execute later when a reply is received. This functionality forms
the basis for E's model of optimistic computation. </P>
