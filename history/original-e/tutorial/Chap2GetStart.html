<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can download the E extensions from the Electric Communities website,
<TT>http://www.communities.com</TT>. For installation and configuration
instructions, see the online <TT>README.TXT</TT> file. For information
on last minute updates to E, see the online RELEASE.TXT file. All the documentation
for the E extensions (including this tutorial) is also available online,
both in HTML and postscript format. </P>

<H2><A NAME="SYNTAX"></A>E syntax and terminology</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This section describes basic E syntax and terminology, including the
following concepts:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Channel<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Distributor<BR>
</LI>

<LI>E-class<BR>
</LI>

<LI>E-method<BR>
</LI>

<LI>einterface<BR>
</LI>

<LI>E-send<BR>
</LI>

<LI>eif<BR>
</LI>

<LI>ewhen<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>For more detailed information on these concepts, see the <A HREF="http://www.communities.com/e/glossary.html">Glossary</A>,
and also the <I>E Programmer's Manual.</I></P>

<P>In E, objects send<I> </I>messages to other objects, either on the same
or on a remote machine. As you would send a message to a friend across
town or across the country, and have a reasonable expectation that your
friend would be the person to receive it (instead of their entire neighborhood),
so E-objects send specific messages to each other. An E-object can be any
of three things:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>A <I>Channel. </I></B>This is conduit object that channels a message
from one object to another, without ever understanding or handling the
message. A channel serves as a placeholder for any values that the recipient
object may furnish.You can only send messages <I>through</I> channels,
not <I>to</I> them. A channel is directed to a specific destination using
its associated distributor.</LI>

<P>When the message contains a request for some value to be supplied by
the receiving object, a channel back to the sending object is included
as one of the message parameters. This is like the concept of a self addressed
stamped envelope.</P>

<LI>A <B><I>Distributor. </I></B>This is an object that points the message
to the intended receiving object or objects. It's like a one way nozzle
on the end of a channel; you can spray the messages out, but you can't
reverse the flow. <A NAME="447128"></A>A distributor is associated only
with a channel. You send a <TT>forward</TT> message to the distributor
that tells it where to direct the channel (that is, what object is going
to receive the message). You can forward messages to one or many destinations
at once (known as a <I>multicast) </I>which lets you send a single message
to several objects simultaneously. When a multicast is specified, there
is still only one channel and one distributor.</LI>

<P><A NAME="447485"></A>If you want to send a message to a distributor
(for example, in order to send it a <TT>forward</TT> message) you use the
distributor operator, which is the ampersand (<TT>&amp;</TT>). This operator
lets you interact with the distributor as an E-class.</P>

<LI>A<I> <B>value</B>. </I>An E-object can have either its own or another
object's value. </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="447075"></A>E-classes receive a given message by using <I>E-methods</I>.
An E-method is a block of code invoked when the E-object receives a message
of the given E-method name. E-methods never return values because of the
nature of E. The only ways to receive a requested value is through channels
and distributors, and through deferring statements such as e<TT>when</TT>
and <TT>eif</TT> ( mentioned in the following paragraphs). </P>

<P><A NAME="447285"></A>You define an E-method using the keyword <TT>emethod</TT>.
Unlike a Java method, an E-method creates a private void method, and is
not directly accessible with normal Java programming techniques. </P>

<P><A NAME="447076"></A>To send a message, you use the <TT>send</TT> operator,
which is the left arrow symbol (<TT>&lt;-</TT>). In Java, you call a method
and wait until a message arrives. In E, you send your message and forget
about it, assuming that the message will arrive and be acted upon. </P>

<P><A NAME="445912"></A>The <TT>ewhen</TT> and <TT>eif</TT> statements
defer execution of their associated code block until a value has been furnished
for an expression. You use <TT>ewhen</TT> and <TT>eif</TT> to enforce security,
to obtain values from other E-objects, and to bind Java and E. As you go
through the tutorials, you'll see how this is done. </P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>ewhen</TT> is an unconditional statement: &quot;When I have x,
unconditionally do y.&quot; </LI>

<LI><TT>eif</TT> is a conditional statement: &quot;When I have x, If x
is true, do this, if x is false, do that.&quot; </LI>
</UL>

<P>If you want to send a message to a distributor (for example, in order
to send it a forward message) you use the distributor operator, which is
the ampersand (<TT>&amp;</TT>). This operator lets you interact with the
distributor as an E-class.</P>

<H2><A NAME="PRINCIPLES"></A>General principles for programming E applications</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You'll find these guidelines repeated in more detail in the <I>E Programmer's
Manual,</I>, but they are important concepts to remember when programming
in E and are worth reviewing here. If you are already comfortable with
the concept of writing code with optimistic computation in mind, you can
skip this section. </P>

<OL>
<LI>Write your code as if you already have the answers. This means writing
your code as if you already have all the values you need for computation.</LI>

<LI>Create message protocols that deliver the values you need. Set up channels
(usually unforwarded at this stage) and distributors to move this information
when it becomes available. This code goes at the beginning.</LI>

<LI>Write <TT>ewhen</TT> and <TT>eif</TT> statements for each value that
you assumed you had in step 1. These statements follow the protocols and
encompasses the body of code you wrote in step 1. They enforce security
by insuring that the code which uses a value you assumed does not get executed
until after it actually gets that value.</LI>

<LI>For each value for which you initially provided an unforwarded channel,
write a forward statement that will deliver the value at the time you specify.</LI>
</OL>
