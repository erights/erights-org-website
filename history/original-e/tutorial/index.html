<HR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Welcome to the E Language Tutorial. This tutorial is a series of annotated
E sample applications you can run to test E in your own environment. </P>

<P>For information on how to install, and configure E, see the README.TXT
file that is packaged with the E software. For an overview of E and its
concepts, see the document <A HREF="Chap1Intro.html">Introduction to E.</A>
For information on basic E syntax and terminology to help you get started
on the sample programs, see the document <A HREF="Chap2GetStart.html">Getting
Started.</A></P>

<P>Select one of the following tutorials to learn more about E. These programs
are also available in the online Example suite downloaded with your software.</P>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="Chap3HelloWorld.html">Hello World</A> </DT>

<DD>This is the familiar Hello World application. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="Chap4HelloEWhen.html">Hello Ewhen</A> </DT>

<DD>This tutorial demonstrates the <TT>ewhen</TT> statement. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="Chap5HelloEwhenInv.html">Hello EWhen, Inverse</A> </DT>

<DD>This tutorial demonstrates more advanced features of the <TT>ewhen
</TT>statement. </DD>

<DT><A HREF="Chap6RollingDice.html">Rolling Dice</A> </DT>

<DD>This tutorial demonstrates using nested <TT>ewhen</TT> statements to
achieve random and uninfluenced results in a rolling dice program. </DD>
</DL>

<P>There is also a <A HREF="../glossary.html">glossary</A> that lists and
describes E terms.</P>

<P>NOTE: You will also want to check out other examples in the online suite
that are not covered in this tutorial. These examples demonstrate other
features of E, such as its communication facilities.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The E programming language was largely inspired by the language Joule,
currently being developed by Dean Tribble, Norm Hardy, and their colleagues
at Agorics, Inc. of Los Altos, California. Indeed, the fundamental idea
behind E was to take the core ideas from Joule and apply them to Java.
Our friends at Agorics have b een generous advisors and invaluable teachers;
E would not have been possible wi thout their support. </P>
