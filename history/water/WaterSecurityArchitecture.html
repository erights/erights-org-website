<H1>Water Security Architecture</H1></DIV>
<P>Whenever parties interact with one another via computer systems and 
communication networks -- as when a consumer buys a product from a vendor using 
a desktop computer, the Internet, and a web server, or when participants in an 
Internet-enabled conference exchange confidential information -- it's important 
to ensure that the interaction doesn't make any of the parties vulnerable to 
injury from mistaken or aggressive acts. Clear Methods believes that a security 
architecture should be designed to be programmer-friendly, so that the secure 
way to write a program is also the easy way to write it. If security is an 
annoyance, it will be neglected, and if it's an obstacle to enabling the 
interaction patterns favored by the programmer or required by an application, it 
will likely be compromised. 
<H3>Status quo</H3>
<P>Conventional security architectures start with the paradigm of a 
<I>principal</I> (user) who asks a system (application, operating system, etc.) 
to perform some action on their behalf. Having established the security of the 
communication channel (<I>privacy</I>) and the identity of the principal 
(<I>authentication</I>), the system then decides based on its prior knowledge of 
the principal whether the request should be granted (<I>authorization</I>). 
<P>Principal-based frameworks assume that a system is a monolithic entity, and 
that once a principal is authenticated the entire system carries the entire 
authority of that principal. This neglects the fact that real systems are made 
up of many small pieces, of varying reliability and trustworthiness, that 
delegate work to one another. The risk is that an unreliable piece may use 
authority that it doesn't need to do something, either unintentionally or 
intentionally, that it shouldn't do. 
<P>Some security frameworks allow for a module (such as an file I/O system) to 
have restrictions placed on its authority. For example, modules from vendors A 
and B may together form an application in which vendor A's module can perform 
network I/O but not access the window system, while vendor's B's module can 
access the window system but not the network. To establish such security 
policies and arrange to have them enforced is a complex, error-prone process not 
integrated with system design and assembly. The temptation on the programmer's 
part is to make the modules as large as possible in order to avoid having to 
describe the security structure, but such over-authorized modules invite 
security errors and therefore attacks. 
<H3>Water's solution</H3>
<P>Water accomplishes its security goals by taking the principal of 
minimally-authorized system components to its extreme by running each object in 
its own protection domain. Each object possesses certain rights, and can only 
obtain new rights through a small number of highly controlled operations. An 
object is similar to an operating system protection domain (process or address 
space), and a right in Water corresponds to an operating system resource such as 
a network connection or an open-file handle. 
<P>With object-oriented security, the notion of principal goes away except in 
rare "login" situations, and is replaced by objects that have certain particular 
rights that may have ultimately come from principals through a chain of 
object-to-object delegation. 
<P>Like Java, Water establishes a "virtual operating system" so that multiple 
objects can live in the same address space as provided by the underlying 
operating system. However, Water establishes strict inter-object isolation by 
ensuring that all language primitives and API's enforce strict and appropriate 
right transfer rules. This makes the analogy to a secure operating system exact 
and eliminates the threat posed by the use of a shared address space. Water also 
reduces run-time security overhead relative to Java because there is rarely any 
need to consult a security policy to ensure that the running module has some 
particular right: either it possesses a right or it doesn't, and this is 
immediately knowable. 
<P>For example, an object cannot open a file unless it possesses a right, in the 
form of a reference to a particular directory object, that denotes the ability 
to open files in a particular directory or file system. An object will not have 
this right unless the right has been explicitly transferred to the object. This 
rights transfer may happen when a module is linked into a running system (in the 
same way that rights in Java are connected with classes and mediated by the 
class loader), but it is also easy in Water to grant rights only to individual 
objects or to restrict rights before granting them (e.g. to limit access to a 
particular subdirectory). The patterns of rights transfer are the same as any 
other kind of object construction and transfer in the language, making security 
a natural side effect of object-oriented design, not an add-on feature that 
programmers are likely to neglect. 
<P>An object's methods specify a set of rights, but when a reference the object 
is given out, some restriction or <I>encapsulation</I> may be necessary. Water 
generalizes the private/package/public method set distinction made by Java with 
a <I>view</I> feature allowing as many different encapsulations of an object as 
are needed for different clients of the object. 
<P>Water's approach to security borrows from a long tradition of secure systems 
research. It is similar in spirit to <A 
href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/keykosindex.html">KeyKOS</A>, which was 
designed for an Orange Book B2 security rating (corresponding to <A 
href="http://www.sans.org/infosecFAQ/securitybasics/criteria.htm">Common 
Criteria</A> EAL5). Also in the same spirit are the Actors languages of Hewitt 
et al. [C. Hewitt, Viewing control structures as patterns of passing messages, 
<I>Journal of Artificial Intelligence,</I> 8-3:323-364, 1977] and the currently 
active <A href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</A> project.
