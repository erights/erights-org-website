      <hr> <!-- #BeginEditable "LongBody" --> The first smart contracting system was 
      <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/chapter2_76.html">AMIX<img src="../images/amix.gif" width="64" height="48" border="0"></a> 
      (and <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/08/27/priceline/index2.html">this</a>), 
      the American Information Exchange. Here's only a slight idealization of 
      how it worked. 
      <h3 ALIGN="left">Split Contracts</h3>
      <P ALIGN="left">When people contracted with each other through the AMIX 
        system, they expressed the contract in two parts: one that both human 
        and the AMIX software could understand, and that the AMIX software could 
        enforce; and the other as free form text only for humans to interpret, 
        but unforgeably attached to the first part. 
      <P ALIGN="left">For example, Alice and Bob may have committed to a mini-consulting 
        contract for Bob to deliver to Alice a document answering certain questions 
        Alice needs answered. The automated part of the contract might say 
      <P ALIGN="left"> 
      <ul>
        <li> Alice is to pay Bob $100 on delivery of the deliverable </li>
        <li> Alice is to pay Bob $500 on acceptance of the deliverable </li>
        <li> Alice has 30 days to evaluate the deliverable </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The free form text expresses the question Bob is to answer, and that 
        answers to these questions constitute an acceptable deliverable. </p>
      <p>Later, when Bob delivers a document as a deliverable, Bob is making a 
        claim that this deliverable meets the criteria described. At this point, 
        Bob is assured by Amix of receiving the $100, whether or not Amix can 
        collect the corresponding $100 from Alice. (Ideally, such a risk-bearing 
        intermediary would be a separate party from a contract-host, but AMIX 
        bundled these together.) </p>
      <p>When Alice looks at the deliverable, she may hit an "approved" button, 
        in which case Bob likewise gets $500. If 30 days go by without Alice taking 
        any action, then she has implicitly approved, and Bob still gets $500. 
        Alternatively, Alice may reject by making a claim that the deliverable 
        does not meet the description. This claim directly conflicts with the 
        claim Bob made by providing the deliverable. The text of the agreement, 
        the text of the deliverable, and the two conflicting claims can now go 
        to human arbitration. </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Why is the Contract Smart?</h3>
      <p>This systems lacks <i>many</i> of the attributes all of us are interested 
        in building. However, its power came from embodying a complex contractual 
        relationships in computational material. This power would not follow just 
        from having a strongly secure untraceable payment system. </p>
      <p>Current contracts are passive pieces of paper, only to be interpreted 
        by humans. The phrase "<i>possession is nine tenths of the law</i>" means 
        that current physical location and control is a huge bias in resolving 
        a dispute. Why? In the absence of costly arbitration, we are left with 
        such <i>possession</i> as the outcome.</p>
      <p>In normal consulting, if Alice doesn't pay Bob, chances are Bob's screwed. 
        Alice's lack of payment is inaction, not action, and can not obviously 
        be treated as a factual claim that could be challenged. By contrast, in 
        our the above contract, Alice must act and claim in order to not pay. 
        Inspired by AMIX, one might instead say </p>
      <h3 align="center"> <i>Behavior will be nine tenths of the law</i> </h3>
      <p>When the contracting parties cannot turn the entire contract into computationally 
        enforced behavior, they can instead design a split contract--a set of 
        computational behaviors that bias the outcomes, with the remaining non-computational 
        part of the contract being designed to work in the context of those biases. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Beyond Amix</h3>
      <p>On the down side, AMIX was a non-distributed insecure system that took 
        a conventional stance for dealing the jurisdictional issues. In particular, 
        AMIX knew the true names of its customers. </p>
      <p>AMIX was also non-extensible. It had one extraordinarily well designed 
        smart contract, but if customers of AMIX wanted to write new code to embody 
        a new contractual relationship, AMIX couldn't help them. (These aren't 
        criticisms -- AMIX did everything described above in late 80s/early 90s, 
        before the web. It was extraordinary.) </p>
      <p>So what are we trying to enable with E? A good approximation is a strongly 
        secure, completely decentralized, richly extensible AMIX. E especially 
        shines as a language for clearly expressing complex contractual relationships.</p>
      <p>For example, at the Sun Labs <a href="http://www.sun.com/960201/cover/webmart.html">Webmart</a> 
        project (one of the ancestors of E) we created and deployed a lightweight 
        market institution to solve the scarcity of an individual rooftop satellite 
        receiver dish. The dish was bought as a resource for the lab as a whole, 
        but it could only be pointed in one direction at a time. How should this 
        <i>right to point</i> be allocated? We created a futures market in time 
        slices, built from distributed capabilities.</p>
      <p>Starting with an object representing the ability to control the satellite, 
        a small amount of code was able to create derivative rights, in layers, 
        building up to tradable exclusive rights to command the dish during future 
        time slots. These rights could be exchanged via reusable escrow exchange 
        agents and auctions, neither of which knew about futures, much less satellite 
        dishes. We expect to be posting simple E code for escrow-exchange, auctions, 
        futures, etc on the ERights.org site soon.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="http://www.agorics.com/agoricpapers.html">Agoric Open 
        Systems</a> papers for many ideas about use of fine-grained markets in 
        computation. We believe there's a smooth spectrum </p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>from agoric computational markets for computational agents, </li>
        <li>through fully automated contracts with human decision makers -- like 
          the Sun Labs futures market, </li>
        <li>to the split contracts (partially smart, partially human arbitrated) 
          of AMIX. </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>We expect E to cover this spectrum, but this time we're focusing on 
        split contracts first.</p>
