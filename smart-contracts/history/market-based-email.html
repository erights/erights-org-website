    "At least 80% of the email I get is a waste of time to even 
  open," says Tom Steding, vice president of strategic 
  marketing at 3Com Corporation, the world's leading maker of 
  Ethernet networking systems.  He's not alone.  Executives, 
  managers, and knowledge workers at firms with sophisticated 
  information systems are drowning in an Info-flood, a daily 
  deluge of emails, voicemails, and faxes.  
  <p>
  Forced to spend three hours of each twelve hour workday 
  handling about 150 incoming messages, Steding thinks, "The 
  volume of email is so high, it's become devalued.  Sending 
  an email is no longer sufficient to ensure communication.  
  You've got to go see them nose-to-nose.  It's like the old 
  way, except back then you didn't have to send email first.  
  We're going backwards."
</p><p>
    The Information Revolution was supposed to save time and 
  eliminate drudgery.  What's gone wrong?  Are we doomed to 
  suffer from Info-overload from here to eternity?  Or do we 
  just need better tools for sifting info-wheat from 
  info-chaff?
  </p><p>
  If such tools can be invented, they'll have to be aligned 
  with the fundamental properties of information itself.  
  Claude Shannon, the father of "communications theory," and 
  the fellow who coined the term "bit" (binary unit), once 
  said "Information is news that makes a difference.  If it 
  doesn't make a difference, it isn't information."  A radio 
  traffic report about a car crash up ahead is information if 
  you can still change your route.  But if you're already 
  stuck in the backup, the message is a useless bunch of bits.  
  </p><p>
  By Shannon's definition, most of the messages coursing 
  through corporate networks aren't worthy of the name 
  "information."  Junk messages clog emailboxes, obscure 
  useful information, and force workers to waste hours each 
  day simply trying to keep up with the flow of messages.  
  </p><p>
  Some observers blame the "group list" feature found on 
  today's messaging systems.  "Group lists are an incredibly 
  efficient tool for disseminating information when it's 
  relevant to everyone in the group," says Don Wood, director 
  of marketing at Octel Communications, a leading voicemail 
  systems supplier.  "But the abuse of group lists causes a 
  huge waste of time.  Virtually all the junk I get comes from 
  being on so many group lists."
  </p><p>
  In a way, the "group list" phenomenon expresses the best and 
  worst aspects of the Information Revolution.  In two 
  decades, innovation has slashed the cost of moving bits 
  about a million-fold.  Today, the incremental cost of 
  sending out one more copy of an electronic message is 
  virtually zero.  
  </p><p>
  Taking advantage of this remarkable technical achievement, 
  everyone with email or voicemail access can be a 
  micro-broadcaster, able to inundate colleagues at no cost to 
  herself or her department.  Almost overnight, the 
  elimination of sending costs has reversed the fundamental 
  economics of communication.  Instead of costly transmission 
  limiting the message supply, today's scarce resource is the 
  attention span of recipients.  
  </p><p>
  To counteract the "group list" problem and reduce time 
  wasted sorting messages, software firms like 
  Massachusetts-based Beyond, Inc. have introduced so-called 
  "Bozo filters" that cull out unwanted messages.  These 
  programs prioritize incoming messages once users have 
  entered the names of those whom they want -- and don't want -- to 
  get email from.  Octel recently introduced a similar feature 
  for its voicemail systems.  Presumably, a message from your 
  boss will leap to the top of the stack, while the memo 
  announcing a change to the company dental plan slips to the 
  bottom.  
  </p><p>
  As a first step, using a "Bozo filter" may be better than 
  leaving your emailbox undefended.  But in the final 
  analysis, filtering software can't get to the heart of the 
  problem.  Since filters require you to preload the names of 
  people from whom you want mail, they assume you already know 
  what you want to know, or at least who you want to hear 
  from.  But "news that makes a difference" -- that flash of 
  insight or speck of data that alters the course of a 
  business or a career -- often comes from unexpected sources.  
  </p><p>
  What's really needed is a quick, easy way of gauging the 
  value of an incoming message.  Since the sender is the only 
  one in a position to guess whether a message might be of 
  value to the receiver, the sender should label each message 
  with a super compact indicator of value -- more commonly known 
  as a price.
  </p><p>
  Prices are, after all, a wonderfully concise form of 
  information about information.  Everything known about a 
  company's financial performance and prospects is reduced to 
  one number -- its stock price.  Instead of analyzing stacks of 
  data comparing various products, we often rely on their 
  relative prices to guide our choices.  Price signals allow 
  us to instantly assess relative values and focus our 
  attention on the subtle issues that deserve careful 
  scrutiny.
  </p><p>
  Imagine an email or voicemail system where the sender 
  indicated her sense of the content's value by attaching 
  "urgent, standard, or junk" levels of "electronic postage" 
  on each copy of an outgoing message.  The "postage" would be 
  charged against her budget.  Conversely, her account would 
  be credited with the value of postage attached to messages 
  she opens.  With senders once again facing some marginal 
  cost for each message they put out, they'd think twice 
  before copying someone without reason.  The profligate use 
  of group lists would disappear, the volume of junk messages 
  would plummet, and recipients would zero in on messages 
  bearing the most "postage" -- and the most importance.  
  </p><p>
  Though little known, a messaging system quite close to this 
  approach was implemented a few years back at AMIX, a now 
  defunct Silicon Valley startup.  Alongside its normal email 
  system, AMIX launched a market-based messaging system.  
  Message headers like "$5 if you read this message," gave 
  recipients an incentive to open their mail.  Individuals 
  accounts were credited with moneys debited from the sender's 
  account.  
  </p><p>
  Mark Miller, who helped design the system, reports that 
  AMIX's conventional email system fell into disuse as people 
  switched over to a market-oriented system that rewarded them 
  for the time they spent handling messages.  "Instead of 
  treating email as a chore," says Miller, "people began 
  seeing it as an opportunity." 
  </p><p>
  Asked why the market approach to network management hasn't 
  caught on yet, 3Com's Tom Steding replies: "The perception 
  of the problem has to get to the point where people will 
  want to do something dramatically different.  Despite all 
  the groaning, the cost of wasted time is widely distributed 
  and unmeasured."  True enough.  But even a rough calculation 
  shows that thousands of hours wasted sorting email adds up 
  to big dollars.
  </p><p>
  Miller, now senior architect at Los Altos-based Agorics, 
  Inc., has another explanation for the slow development of 
  market-based messaging management.  "Even with the emergence 
  of markets in financial derivatives, the idea of markets in 
  non-physical goods, in abstractions like 'a moment of your 
  attention,' 'the right to pollute,' or 'the right to 
  transmit on a given frequency' is still very 
  counterintuitive.  Besides, the naive assumption is that 
  better technology will eliminate congestion."
  </p><p>
  But paradoxically, advancing technology only worsens network 
  congestion.  For example, with the coming shift from 
  Ethernet to fiber, network capacity will jump at least 60 
  times, and make videomail feasible.  The hitch is that "Two 
  frames of video require more bits than a month's worth of 
  email at most companies," says Miller.  Though a short 
  videomail may convey more information value to the viewer 
  than the same message sent via email, each video bit carries 
  radically less information value than each text bit.  If the 
  network treats all bits as equals, videomail will congest 
  the fibernet and keep "old-fashioned" email from getting 
  through. 
  </p><p>
  Recognizing that the only way to intelligently prioritize 
  messages is by allowing senders and receivers to bid for 
  access to the network, Miller and his colleagues at Agorics 
  are now developing a market-based fibernet management system 
  that uses an internal software agent acting as a bandwidth 
  auctioneer.  
  </p><p>
  Just as today's networks unleashed a flood of low value per 
  bit email and voicemail, fiber will soon make it possible to 
  send ultra low value per bit videomail.  Filters can't hold 
  back this tide.  No matter how much capacity is added to a 
  net, its bit traffic will grow even faster.  As system 
  complexity evolves, message pricing will become the only 
  sensible way to allocate the bandwidth that matters -- the 
  bandwidth between your ears.
