        <P CLASS="western"><B>Abstract</B>: A central claim of the modern Austrian 
          school is that a competitive market order can solve the knowledge problem 
          while a centrally planned economy cannot. While Austrians such as Hayek 
          have focused on the essential role of abstract rules and the coordinating 
          role of prices, they have largely neglected the familiar, day-to-day 
          institutions of store fronts, standardized contracts, and specific markets 
          towards which people orient their actions. These secondary institutions, 
          as Lachmann calls them, are examples of what software developers call 
          abstraction boundaries. Abstraction boundaries both categorize knowledge 
          into productive divisions and coordinate plans through time. We apply 
          the software concepts of abstraction and modularity to better understand 
          how these institutions promote both coherence and change. We argue that 
          the drawing and redrawing of abstraction boundaries is a neglected aspect 
          of the market process. </P>

          Introduction</H1>
        <P CLASS="western">The exploration of the knowledge problem &ndash; the 
          ability of an economic system to generate and sustain a complex structure 
          of production based on an extensive division of knowledge &ndash; formed 
          a central theme of Don Lavoie&rsquo;s research. His critique of central 
          planning and investigations into the nature of knowledge led him to 
          emphasize the indispensable role of the market process in solving the 
          knowledge problem.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Only the market process can harness the diverse knowledge of millions 
          of people into an evolving pattern of cooperative relationships that 
          serves an ever increasing variety of individual purposes. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">According to the critique of central planning developed 
          by Mises, Hayek, Lavoie and others, central planners lack the knowledge 
          necessary to successfully plan production and calculate economic tradeoffs. 
          Central planners do not have access to the tacit and contextual knowledge 
          that individuals use in planning their activities, nor do they have 
          access to competitive price and profit signals that are required for 
          calculating tradeoffs among the myriad uses of scarce means. The effective 
          use of knowledge, Lavoie argues, requires a decentralized solution &ndash; 
          a solution provided by the market process. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">For the market process to make effective use of knowledge, 
          it must solve two problems: 1) it must divide knowledge to capture gains 
          from specialization, and 2) it must coordinate the separate plans of 
          market participants to secure gains from cooperation. Gains from specialization 
          arise when &lsquo;people can use other people&rsquo;s knowledge to their 
          own advantage without themselves acquiring it.&rsquo; (Vaughn, 1999, 
          p. 133) Specialization economizes on knowledge production by reusing 
          proven solutions. Specialization increases knowledge production by encouraging 
          the discovery of new solutions; knowledge, as Brian Loasby reminds us, 
          &lsquo;grows through division.&rsquo; (Loasby, 1999, p. 50)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Each increase in specialization &lsquo;necessitates 
          additional coordination somewhere in the social structure.&rsquo; (High, 
          1986, p. 117) Specialized activities must be combined with complementary 
          activities, and individual plans based on time and place specific knowledge 
          must be coordinated with those of others. (Hayek 1937, 1945) The market 
          process must do more than just coordinate plans based on dispersed knowledge 
          that exists at a point in time; it must also adapt these plans to new 
          knowledge constantly being created in the pursuit of further gains from 
          specialization and cooperation. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">The market process solves the twin problems of the 
          division and coordination of knowledge through abstraction. Abstraction 
          modularizes knowledge. Abstractions, by selectively hiding information, 
          enable market participants to make use of a complex network of specialized 
          knowledge without needing to acquire the knowledge themselves. As one 
          computer scientist (Turbak, 2002, p. 4) describes it: </P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Abstraction is ubiquitous in the modern 
          world and we depend on it for functioning in our day-to-day lives. We 
          are able to use a wide array of machines and devices (e.g. cars, telephones, 
          stereos, computers) without having to understand the details of how 
          they work. Supermarkets, department stores, and utilities are purveyors 
          of abstractions; for the most part, we do not need or want to know how 
          a loaf of bread is baked, how a piece of clothing is made, or how our 
          electricity, water, and gas are produced. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">To facilitate cooperation, abstractions must be made 
          meaningful to others so that they can use them for their own purposes. 
          Programmers call the process of carving up knowledge into meaningful 
          units creating abstraction boundaries. An abstraction boundary captures 
          a specialized solution to a type of problem and packages it for reuse. 
          The abstraction boundary hides the details of how the solution is implemented 
          from potential users, while providing them with the information they 
          need to apply the solution to their particular problem. Programmers 
          use abstraction to divide programs into modules that can be combined 
          with other modules through well-defined interfaces (the boundaries) 
          to create complex behavior. </P>
        <P CLASS="western"> Abstraction boundaries enhance cooperation by reducing 
          the cost of using the solutions.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Abstraction boundaries limit what clients need to know about solution 
          providers, and what solution providers need to know about their clients. 
          The boundary defines what the solution is, but not how it is provided, 
          nor why it is used. Clients, by orienting their plans to the boundary, 
          can ignore implementation details which are likely to change.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Providers, meanwhile, are free to change how they provide the solution 
          so long as they continue to provide the type of solution defined by 
          the boundary. Abstraction boundaries enable both solution providers 
          and their clients to coordinate and adapt their particular plans based 
          on the abstract plans embodied in the boundary. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">By borrowing concepts from software engineering, we 
          are drawing on work, done during the late 1980s and early 1990s by Lavoie, 
          the current authors and others. The Agorics Project explored the relationships 
          between object-oriented concepts from software engineering and the market 
          institutions of property and contract.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP> 
          As Lavoie remarked, &lsquo;In particular, the concepts surrounding the 
          idea of &ldquo;modularity&rdquo; have proven valuable in rethinking 
          the nature of property rights and evolutionary change in market systems.&rsquo; 
          (Lavoie, 1994, p. xi) The recognition that software developers faced 
          an analogous knowledge problem to that of markets and that they had 
          independently evolved solutions that resemble market solutions suggested 
          that this would be a fruitful line of research to increase our understanding 
          of both systems. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">We argue that the commonality of solutions is no mere 
          coincidence, but a consequence of underlying principles for organizing 
          complex adaptive systems. The concepts of abstraction and modularity 
          that underlie the object-oriented approach to organizing a complex software 
          system also underlie the market process approach to organizing a complex 
          structure of production.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote5anc" HREF="#sdendnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
        </P>
        <P CLASS="western">The Austrian vision of the market process can be enhanced 
          by recognizing the role that abstraction boundaries play in dividing 
          knowledge and coordinating plans. Hayek&rsquo;s (1973, 1976) account 
          of an abstract order based on abstract rules provides a framework for 
          understanding abstraction boundaries, but fails to acknowledge their 
          role. What Lachmann (1971) calls secondary institutions &ndash; the 
          day-to-day institutions towards which people orient their actions &ndash; 
          fills the gap, capturing what we mean by abstraction boundaries. Abstraction 
          boundaries also shed light on how markets deal with the problem of institutional 
          coherence and change. (Lachmann 1971, 1979, 1991) By facilitating orderly 
          change, abstraction boundaries coordinate plans through time. Following 
          Lavoie, we argue that abstraction boundaries emerge as part of the market 
          process; they are best viewed as negotiated categories resulting from 
          the dynamic process of exchange and dialogue. </P>
        <P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Between 
          abstract rules and concrete purposes</B></FONT></FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="western">Friedrich Hayek, in particular, emphasizes the fundamental 
          importance of abstraction. Abstractions, he explains, &lsquo;are a means 
          to cope with the complexity of the concrete which our mind is not capable 
          of fully mastering.&rsquo; (1973, p. 29) What he calls &lsquo;the primacy 
          of the abstract&rsquo; (1978), is deeply woven into his vision of the 
          market order, visible in many diverse strands of his thought. The primacy 
          of the abstract stems from his work on the mind, begun while he was 
          his twenties and later elaborated and presented in <I>The Sensory Order</I>. 
          (1952b) His theory of the mind informs numerous aspects of his work 
          including the limits to understanding complex phenomena, his concept 
          of spontaneous order, and the importance of abstract rules of conduct. 
          While Hayek paints a complex picture of the multi-faceted role of abstraction, 
          he does not seem to recognize the role of abstraction boundaries. Abstraction 
          boundaries, we argue, emerge as a natural complement to his discussion 
          of abstract orders based on abstract rules. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Hayek presents the mind as a system of classification. 
          We do not first perceive the world in its detailed particulars and then 
          build up more abstract representations. To the contrary, our ability 
          to perceive particulars depends on pre-existing abstractions which we 
          use to classify our various sense perceptions. Perception must be viewed 
          as an act of classification; we perceive only certain abstract properties 
          of objects, not concrete details. As Heinrich Kl&uuml;ver elaborates, 
          &lsquo;What we perceive are never unique properties of individual objects, 
          but always only properties which the objects have in common with other 
          objects. Perception is thus always an interpretation, the placing of 
          something into one of several classes of objects.&rsquo; (Hayek, 1952b, 
          p. xviii)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">As Hayek makes clear, the classifying of objects does 
          not proceed based on a simple one-to-one mapping of observed objects 
          into mental categories. It is rather the &lsquo;product of superimposition 
          of many &ldquo;classifications&rdquo; of the events perceived according 
          to their significance in many respects.&rsquo; (1978b, p. 36) Each classification 
          triggers a response in terms of a kind of action; we respond to a certain 
          class of events with a disposition to a certain kind of action. It is 
          only through the superimposition of many classifications and dispositions 
          that a particular action is specified: &lsquo;both the specification 
          of a particular experienced event and the specification of a particular 
          response to it are the result of a superimposition of many such dispositions.&rsquo; 
          (Hayek, 1978b, p. 40)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Specification by superimposition, Hayek claims, is 
          the &lsquo;best description of the mechanism for the operation of &hellip; 
          the primacy of the abstract, because each of its causal determinants 
          decides only one of the attributes of the resulting action.&rsquo; (1978b, 
          p. 48) The specification of action through the superimposition of multiple 
          dispositions enables the individual to make use of knowledge of typical 
          aspects of a situation while adapting the response to the unique aspects. 
          The various dispositions serve as adaptations to the typical features 
          of the environment. By superimposing many dispositions, we are able 
          to generate unique responses to novel situations.</P>
        <P CLASS="western"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hayek, especially in his later 
          work, presents a vision of the market order that is remarkably similar 
          to his account of the sensory order. Both mind and market are examples 
          of what Butos and McQuade (1999) describe as knowledge-generating orders 
          &ndash; orders where the knowledge generated consists of classifications 
          meaningful in the context of that order. They argue that </FONT><FONT FACE="TimesNewRoman, serif">&lsquo;it 
          is strictly incorrect to say that the market gathers up &ldquo;divided&rdquo; 
          individual knowledge and makes this information available to many others 
          &hellip;. </FONT>Instead, the market takes, as input, knowledge in the 
          individual sense &hellip; and classifies this, producing a totally different 
          kind of knowledge.&rsquo; <FONT COLOR="#000000">(1999, p. 29)</FONT></P>
        <P CLASS="western">Classifications provide knowledge that others can use. 
          They abstract from detailed particular circumstances and purposes to 
          provide reusable knowledge of general circumstances that can be applied 
          to multiple purposes. They enable individuals to economize on knowledge 
          by substituting abstract knowledge of the class for specific knowledge 
          of the instances. Hayek&rsquo;s work suggests that these classifications 
          exist at multiple layers and adjust continuously to changing circumstances 
          and accumulated experience. This multi-layered view of the knowledge-generating 
          properties of the market order stands in contrast however, to the stark 
          distinction Hayek seems to draw between the roles that abstract rules 
          and concrete purposes play in creating that order.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Hayek argues that the emergence of the extended order 
          of cooperation (1989) rests on the gradual change from a society organized 
          around the common pursuit of a limited number of concrete purposes to 
          a society organized around adherence to a common set of abstract rules 
          of conduct that coordinate a countless number of diverse purposes.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Rules of conduct are abstract in the sense that they abstract from the 
          concrete purposes and circumstances. They abstract from particular circumstances 
          of time and place to capture certain general circumstances that have 
          proven useful for the pursuit of many diverse plans. Abstract rules 
          are purpose independent: they serve no particular purpose, but improve 
          the chances for success of a large number of different purposes. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Actions based on abstract rules generate an abstract 
          order. Abstract orders are formed spontaneously, not by deliberate arrangement. 
          They are based on abstract relations serving multiple purposes, not 
          concrete relations serving a single purpose. By serving multiple purposes, 
          the complexity of abstract orders is &lsquo;not limited to what a human 
          mind can master.&rsquo; (1973, p. 38) The abstract order exists independently 
          of any particular member; the order persists through the abstract relations 
          that define it. Hayek (1973, p. 39) tells us that abstract orders</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.17in">&hellip; consist 
          of a system of abstract relations between elements which are also defined 
          only by abstract properties&hellip;. The significance of the abstract 
          character of such orders rests on the fact that they may persist while 
          all the particular elements they comprise, and even the number of such 
          elements, change. All that is necessary to preserve such an abstract 
          order is that a certain structure of relationships be maintained, or 
          that elements of a certain kind (but variable in number) continue to 
          be related in a certain manner. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Abstract rules enhance the ability of individuals to 
          predict the actions of others. They increase predictability by delimiting 
          protected domains of actions. Domains of action provide a place where 
          individuals can plan based on their particular knowledge. They provide 
          a space where individuals can make use of their resources free from 
          interference by others. Abstract rules must do more, however, than just 
          prevent plan interference by delimiting protected domains of actions. 
          They must provide us with a way to connect these separate domains into 
          cooperative relationships. Hayek (1973, p. 99) tells us that:</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">What is required if the separate actions 
          of the individuals are to result in an overall order is that they not 
          only do not unnecessarily interfere with one another, but also that 
          in those respects in which the success of the action of the individuals 
          depends on some matching action by others, there will be at least a 
          good chance that this correspondence will actually occur. But all rules 
          can achieve in this respect is to make it easier for people &hellip; 
          to form that match; abstract rules cannot actually secure that this 
          will always happen. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">While Hayek highlights the importance of matching complementary 
          actions, he provides us with little guidance on how the matching process 
          takes place. His distinction between purpose-independent rules and purposeful 
          action suggests that coordination occurs at the level of concrete purposes 
          and plans. The attempt to match concrete plans directly with other concrete 
          plans, however, leads to plan failure as circumstances change. In the 
          face of change, people must constantly adapt their plans in unforeseeable 
          ways. Concrete plans are highly brittle in the face of such changes. 
          All plans, however, need not share the same level of concreteness; plans 
          may differ in their degree of specificity. Abstract plans, that encompass 
          a range of specific purposes, are likely to be more robust in the face 
          of changing circumstances. By capturing the abstract aspects of many 
          individual plans and embodying them in market institutions, market participants 
          can enhance their ability to coordinate their plans through time. The 
          matching process occurs not through direct matching of concrete plans 
          but through matching of abstract plans embodied in institutions.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">The problem with Hayek&rsquo;s treatment of abstract 
          rules, one might say, is that it is too abstract. He does not explain 
          how these abstract rules are specified into concrete actions that coordinate 
          plans. While he highlights the importance of judge-made law in delimiting 
          domains of action, he fails to provide an account of how market participants 
          through their everyday actions convert abstract rules into institutions 
          that facilitate the matching of complementary activities. The boundaries 
          defined by abstract rules must do more than separate activities where 
          they conflict. They must also combine activities where they complement. 
          Hayek&rsquo;s account leaves a large gap in how this occurs; it leaves 
          a gap between abstract rules and concrete purposes. What is missing 
          is the role that market institutions play in filling the gap by classifying 
          useful knowledge and facilitating the matching process required for 
          its reuse.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP>

        <P CLASS="western">Ludwig Lachmann, in his 1971 book, <I>The Legacy of 
          Max Weber</I>, discusses the role that market institutions play in coordinating 
          plans. Like Hayek, he highlights the fundamental role played by property, 
          contract, and the rule of law in shaping the market order. Unlike Hayek, 
          he moves beyond abstract rules to discuss the specific institutions 
          of the market order, what he calls secondary institutions. Secondary 
          institutions &lsquo;gradually evolve as a result of market processes 
          and other forms of spontaneous individual action.&rsquo; (1971, p. 81)

        <P CLASS="western">These concrete institutions embody abstract plans. 
          They fill the gap between purpose-independent abstract rules and specific 
          concrete purposes. A plan, Lachmann tell us, &lsquo;is but a generalization 
          of purpose.&rsquo; (1971, p. 33) It abstracts the multiple purposes, 
          means, and obstacles pursued by an individual into a comprehensive framework 
          for action. Similarly, a secondary institution is but a generalization 
          of plan, it abstracts from the multiple plans of various individuals 
          to provide a common point of orientation. As Lachmann explains, &lsquo;If 
          the plan is a mental scheme in which the conditions of action are coordinated, 
          we may regard institutions as it were, as orientation schemes of the 
          second order, to which planners orient their plans as actors orient 
          their actions to a plan.&rsquo; (1971, p. 50)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Secondary institutions serve as means of orientation 
          that help coordinate action in society. By orienting our plans towards 
          these institutions, we make use of a vast amount of knowledge without 
          the need to acquire it in detail. Lachmann (1971, p. 50) gives the example 
          of a post office. </P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Whether we post a letter, wait for a train, 
          or draw a cheque, our action is in each case orientated towards a complex

          ends, though we may know next to nothing about the internal working 
          order of these institutions. We know of course that such an internal 
          working-order exists, but in our everyday life take no interest whatever 
          in its details. We know very well that the Post Office works according 
          to a general plan, but such knowledge as we have about it is usually 
          quite irrelevant to the achievement of our purpose in posting a letter. 
          Only a few aspects of this general plan, perhaps the times of collection 
          and delivery of mail, need be of concern to us. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">By drawing our attention to the aspects of an institution 
          with which one interacts, Lachmann is presenting what software designers 
          refer to as an abstraction boundary &ndash; the interface between actors. 
          The abstraction boundary captures the abstract plan common to the various 
          actors. The actors coordinate their actions to the boundary, not to 
          the detailed plans of the other actors. As Lachmann notes, the postal 
          customers need concern themselves with only a few aspects of the post 
          office&rsquo;s plan. These few aspects form the abstraction boundary. 
          The post office communicates these aspects to the postal customers, 
          who rely on these details in forming their own particular plans.</P>

          as an abstraction boundary. The post office as an abstraction boundary 
          represents a particular kind of provider-client relationship. The post 
          office as an organization implements the services defined by the abstraction

          relates to other elements of the more comprehensive order of which it

          and implements the delivery services. It is part of a larger postal 
          system that encompasses additional entities such as delivery vehicles, 
          warehouses, sorting machines, and tracking facilities. From the point

          of the customers&rsquo; plans to focus on the common attributes of transporting 
          a sealed envelope to a specified address. Similarly, the postal customer 
          does not need to know how the commitment to deliver a letter will be 
          implemented. They do not need to know that the mail will be delivered 
          using a tractor-trailer truck if the address is within 500 miles, or 
          delivered by airplane if the address is more than 500 miles away. Both 
          parties, however, need to know the &lsquo;what,&rsquo; that is, the 
          specific steps needed to post the letter. This is the boundary.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">By abstracting on the one side from the specific purpose 
          of a request, and on the other side from the specific way the requested 
          action is implemented, the abstraction boundary enables a large degree 
          of flexibility on both sides. The post office can accommodate a large 
          range of specific reasons for mailing a letter, including ones not yet 
          known. At the same time, the post office is free to try to discover 
          better ways of delivering letters. The entities obtain this flexibility 
          because of the stability of the boundary. The abstraction boundary by 
          capturing the mutual concerns of both parties while abstracting from 
          their particular purposes is able to remain relatively stable in the 
          face of change. The stability and familiarity of the category of a post

        <P CLASS="western">The creation of an abstraction boundary converts a

          directly links a particular solution to a particular purpose. An abstract 
          relationship links a type of solution to a type of purpose through an 
          abstraction boundary. A relationship is abstract when the common services 
          defined in the boundary can be used for multiple purposes, and provided 
          by multiple providers. The abstraction boundary limits what the parties 
          need to know about each other; it allows the provider to treat as common 
          a diverse set of clients, and the client to treat as substitutes a diverse 
          set of providers.</P>

        <P CLASS="western">An abstract relationship combines both reusability 
          and polymorphism. Reusability occurs when a single solution can be reused 
          for multiple purposes. Polymorphism occurs when multiple providers can 
          serve a single purpose. Reusability generalizes across the purposes 
          of the various clients (the particular whys) to focus on the aspects 
          they share in common. Polymorphism generalizes across the implementations 
          of the various providers (the particular hows) to focus on the common 
          services that they provide. Polymorphism enables clients to substitute 
          one provider for another so long as they provide the same type of service; 
          it shields the clients not only from how the services are provided, 
          but also from who provides the service. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Lachmann&rsquo;s post office example highlights the 
          advantages of moving from specific to abstract relationships. Organizing 
          around specific relationships is neither economical nor adaptable. We 
          would not expect to see mail delivery organized around specific relationships 
          on a large scale: a post office specializing in delivering Alice&rsquo;s 
          birthday cards to her grandmother, or a post office specializing in 
          delivering Bob&rsquo;s payment to the gas company. By abstracting from 
          the various purposes, a provider can reuse the common mail delivery 
          solution for multiple purposes. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">By abstracting from the particular implementations, 
          clients can substitute different providers of those services, based 
          on their more exact requirements. Wirfs-Brock and McKean (2002, p. 3) 
          use the example of mail delivery to make this point to programmers.</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Objects that play the same role can be interchanged. 
          For example, there are several providers that can deliver letters and 
          packages: DHL, FedEx, UPS, Post, Airborne. They all have the same purpose, 
          if not the same way of carrying out their business. You choose from 
          among them according to the requirements that you have for delivery. 
          Is it one-day, book rate, valuable, heavy, flammable? You pick the mail 
          carrier that meets your requirements.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Abstraction boundaries play an important cognitive 
          role by classifying various activities into types of activities, and 
          by making these classifications accessible to others. The boundary takes 
          an abstraction and makes it concrete. It reifies the abstraction by 
          articulating it in the design of the interface &ndash; in its contracts, 
          in its store designs, in its customer-facing procedures, and in the 
          design of its products. The abstraction boundary is the invention of 
          the possibility that two entities can interact in a particular way; 
          without the boundary the abstraction is too intangible to be useful.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">In the market context, abstraction boundaries often 
          take the form of transaction boundaries. The abstraction boundary increases 
          the potential for gains from trade by reducing the costs for people 
          seeking a particular kind of trade. An abstraction boundary increases 
          the chances that a particular kind of trade will happen by limiting 
          the types of transactions that can occur through the boundary. There 
          are all sorts of potential gains from trade that may exist between a 
          particular postal customer and a particular postal worker. For example, 
          the postal customer may be in the market for a used car, and the postal 
          worker may be looking to sell his old one. However, this kind of transaction 
          is not permitted through the boundary of the post office. The post office 
          enables the realization of some of the potential gains from trade between 
          postal customers and the postal workers, while ignoring a vast number 
          of other potential gains from trade. By doing so, it increases the chances 
          that many more postal customers and post offices will realize the gains 
          from posting a letter. The abstraction boundary serves as a meeting 
          place for people seeking a particular kind of gain from trade; it provides 
          a familiar place to which people seeking a type of transaction can orient 
          their plans.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP></P>
        <P CLASS="western">The concept of abstraction boundary can also help us 
          answer Lachmann&rsquo;s question of &lsquo;How is the need for coherence 
          and permanence reconciled with that for flexibility in the real world?&rsquo; 
          (1971, p.90) Secondary institutions provide stability with flexibility. 
          Lachmann uses the metaphor of a hinge. He writes, &lsquo;one is tempted 
          to think of the institutional order as an array of hinges: the institutions 
          within each hinge can move a good deal, if within limits, but the hinges 
          themselves cannot.&rsquo; (1979, p. 253) Abstraction boundaries play 
          the role of the hinges, enabling flexibility on both sides of the boundary. 
          Relatively stable abstraction boundaries permit a wide range of changes 
          in purposes and implementations through the separation of concerns. 
          Changes on either side of the boundary will not upset plans so long 
          as the interface does not change. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Abstraction boundaries can coordinate existing plans 
          while supporting new requirements through what programmers call subtyping. 
          A subtype extends the scope of an existing abstraction boundary by adding 
          additional behaviors. Since a subtype must fulfill all of the obligations 
          defined by its supertype, it can be substituted in place of its supertype 
          without upsetting the expectations of existing clients for that type. 
          This enables what Lachmann calls the widening of institutions.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          We can adapt to change &lsquo;not by the creation of a new institution, 
          nor by replacing an old by a new, but by &ldquo;widening&rdquo; an existing 
          institution in such a way that it can serve new interests without upsetting 
          the plans which have thus far made use of it.&rsquo; (1971, p. 91)</P>
        <H1 CLASS="western">Programming as plan coordination</H1>
        <P CLASS="western">As Lachmann&rsquo;s post office example suggests, programming 
          can be usefully analyzed in terms of the Hayekian notion of plan coordination. 
          Programs perform actions: plans are specified by the programmer at design-time; 
          plans are executed by the computer at run-time.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          In order to cope with the <FONT COLOR="#000000">intellectual complexity 
          of large programs</FONT>, programmers divide a program into separate 
          modules, each embodying its own plan of action. The challenge facing 
          programmers can therefore be seen as one of plan coordination; programmers 
          must coordinate the plans of the various modules to ensure the harmonious 
          working of the overall system. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Most software bugs result from plan interference. Breakdown 
          occurs because of coordination failure between parts of the program. 
          Actions taken by one module destroy the assumptions used by another 
          module in planning its actions. Hidden dependencies between modules 
          render assumptions unstable and plans mutually incompatible. For example 
          with procedural programming, the plans of two subroutines may conflict 
          because they unknowingly share the same data. Subroutine A performs 
          a calculation and stores the resulting data for future use. Meanwhile, 
          subroutine B performs its operation overwriting A&rsquo;s data. Subroutine 
          A retrieves the data for further processing, not realizing that it has 
          been modified by B &ndash; leading to unexpected results and potential 
          system failure. </P>

          Centrally planned approaches to software development broke down in the 
          face of increasing complexity, forcing programmers to introduce a division 
          of labor into their programs. Attempts to divide labor according to 
          the principles of procedural programming enabled programmers to build 
          more complex programs, but were subject to massive plan failure when 
          program requirements changed. Procedural programming, which divided 
          the tasks into subroutines while keeping program data in common, could

          improved on procedural programming by dividing both the tasks and the 
          data; it combined the data with the procedures that act on it. By eliminating

        <P CLASS="western">Object-oriented programming divides a program into

          combines a set of related behaviors (its methods) with its private data 
          (its state). The object&rsquo;s type is defined by its set of methods. 
          An object&rsquo;s state &ndash; its particular circumstances of time 
          and place &ndash; is said to be encapsulated because only its methods 
          have the ability to access or modify that state. Other objects cannot 
          directly access the internal state of another object; they must send

        <P CLASS="western">The move from procedural programming to object-oriented 
          programming can be seen as a move from concrete plans to abstract plans. 
          Objects do not coordinate their actions with the specific plans of other 
          objects; they coordinate their actions to the abstract aspects of those 
          plans. An object&rsquo;s interface abstracts from a specific plan to 
          a kind of plan. Object-oriented programming, or more generally the move 
          to encapsulation, message passing, and polymorphism, is essentially 
          trying to move from plan coordination to pattern coordination, (O&rsquo;Driscoll 
          and Rizzo, 1985) where what is meant by patterns is abstracted plans. 
          It does this by re-discovering the virtues of property rights and contract.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP></P>
        <P CLASS="western">Hayek&rsquo;s explanation of the primary virtue of 
          property rights for organizing large scale economic activity parallels 
          the rationale for encapsulation in object-oriented systems: to provide 
          a domain (an object&rsquo;s encapsulation boundary) in which an agent 
          (the object) can execute plans (the object&rsquo;s methods) that use 
          resources (an object&rsquo;s private state), where the proper functioning 
          of these plans depends on these resources not being used simultaneously 
          by conflicting plans. By dividing up the resources of society (the state 
          of a computational system) into separately owned chunks (private object 
          states), we enable a massive number of plans to make use of a massive 
          number of resources without needing to resolve a massive number of conflicting 
          assumptions.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Objects must collaborate to fulfill their responsibilities. 
          They collaborate by sending messages requesting other objects to perform 
          an action. Message passing distributes the responsibility for performing 
          the work of an application across many objects. Each object is responsible 
          for performing services or knowing information useful to others. (Wirfs-Brock 
          and McKean, 2002) The object receiving the message is responsible for 
          determining how to respond to the message. The object&rsquo;s interface 
          defines the set of messages to which it will respond. The interface 
          represents a contract between the object making requests and the object 
          providing the requested service.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote19anc" HREF="#sdendnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          The contract provides &lsquo;a list of the requests that can be made 
          of the server by the client. Both must fulfill the contract: the client 
          by making only those requests it specifies, and the server by responding 
          only to those requests.&rsquo; (Wirfs-Brock and Wilkerson 1989, p. 72)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Object-oriented programming reduces plan interference 
          by encapsulating the computational state of a system into separate objects. 
          It increases plan coordination by combining objects through message 
          passing. Message passing increases the adaptability of the system by 
          basing the interaction between specific objects on the abstraction boundary 
          &ndash; the abstract relationship between types of objects. Collaboration 
          between concrete plans occurs through the coordination of abstract plans.

        <P CLASS="western">The run-time composition of objects by message passing 
          stands in contrast to the design-time organization of abstraction boundaries 
          into a type hierarchy. The type hierarchy defines a static relationship 
          between types, organizing them from more general supertypes to more 
          specific subtypes. The run-time interaction of objects consists of the

          Programmers can enhance the ability of the program to adapt to unforeseen 
          change by &lsquo;programming to an interface and not an implementation.&rsquo; 
          (Gamma et al, 1995, p. 18) By programming to an interface, the programmer 
          orients the behavior of an object to the abstract plans of other objects, 
          not to the concrete plans of specific objects. Objects with different 
          concrete plans can be substituted for one another at run-time without 
          requiring the programmer to rewrite and recompile the program. Market 
          participants, similarly, gain adaptability by orienting their plans 
          to an interface and not an implementation. Programmers and market participants 
          benefit from orienting their plans to stable boundaries, not frequently 
          changing concrete plans. </P>

          Market-oriented programming introduces price signals into a program. 
          Price signals allow objects to dynamically trade-off the scarce computational 
          resources used in carrying out their plans. Objects are alert to opportunities 
          presented by changes in price, and thus able to dynamically shift from 
          one plan to another. All of the adaptation of plans, however, must still 
          take place within the divisions created by the programmer; the system 
          still does not have creativity in the sense of being able to create 
          new divisions. New abstractions are created outside of the system. It

        <P CLASS="western">By recognizing the role of the software designer in 
          creating abstraction boundaries, we highlight an important difference 
          between abstraction boundaries in software and those in markets. In 
          markets, there is no programmer standing outside the economy ready to 
          change the boundaries; there is no exogenous source of change. Changes 
          to abstraction boundaries occur as part of the ongoing market process. 
          Market participants are engaged in the process of drawing and redrawing 
          abstraction boundaries. Abstraction boundaries emerge as negotiated 
          categories that help orient plans.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">The software design process is highly collaborative; 
          software designers engage in a process of dialogue &ndash; with each 
          other and with prospective users of the system &ndash; in order to discover 
          abstraction boundaries.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote23anc" HREF="#sdendnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          The importance of dialogue in creating abstraction boundaries should 
          not be surprising. As Hayek tells us, &lsquo;We learn to classify through 
          language, with which we not merely label known kinds of objects but 
          specify what we are to regard as objects or events of the same or different 
          kinds.&rsquo; (1989, p. 15)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Don Lavoie (1990b, 2003), in particular, has emphasized 
          the creative role of dialogue in markets. He draws on the work of Gadamer 
          (1989) to emphasize the emergence of new meaning from the spontaneous 
          ordering process of dialogue &ndash; a process writ large in the spontaneous 
          ordering process of the market. Lavoie argues that , &lsquo;Markets 
          are an extension of language, and they work through concrete acts of 
          articulation, whether oral or written or electronic. You could say that 
          markets simply add whole new kinds of texts, prices, profits, contracts, 
          advertising, etc., to the conversation.&rsquo; (2003, p. 12) He goes 
          on to urge that, &lsquo;Among the institutional forms that Austrian 
          economists ought to pay attention to are the articulation processes 
          and the resulting texts through which human actors communicate their 
          meanings.&rsquo; (2003, p. 16)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">We suggest that we ought to pay attention to these 
          institutional forms because they represent the process by which abstraction 
          boundaries evolve and the means by which they are formed. Market articulations 
          are attempts to create shared categories of meaning that enable us to 
          coordinate our actions. Abstraction boundaries, in order to serve as 
          orientation points, must be articulated; they must be made concrete.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote24anc" HREF="#sdendnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Articulation in dialogue &ndash; by words and by texts &ndash; creates 
          a space where shared meanings can form. Articulation in markets &ndash; 
          by contracts, by product designs, and by other marketing efforts &ndash; 
          creates a space where shared categories can form. These shared categories 
          serve as points of orientation that help coordinate plans. As Peter 
          Lewin writes, &lsquo;Expectations and plans are, for the most part, 
          fulfilled because of the existence in the social world of shared categories 
          and standards that facilitate the synchronization and coordination of 
          activities.&rsquo; (1999, p. 34)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Lewin illustrates this point by examining the emergence 
          of new categories of products. These categories emerge from attempts 
          to articulate the purpose of new products &ndash; how they are similar, 
          how they are different, and how they relate to other products. He (1999, 
          p. 39) writes:</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">We cope with the complexity in the world 
          by converging on institutions. Thus once the arrival of new products, 
          made possible by the development of a new technology, has been digested, 
          new categories of classifications tend to be developed, into which these 
          products are grouped. These categories emerge spontaneously out of individual 
          attempts to communicate the attributes of the new products. A good example 
          is the products of the computer industry. A whole range of products 
          exist, whose workings remain a mystery to the vast majority of people, 
          but whose purposes needed to be explained. Laptops evolved into notebooks, 
          micro computers into desktops&hellip;. All these shorthands provide 
          the increasingly informed public with a way to tailor their expectations 
          when choosing between products. </P>
        <P CLASS="western"> Shared categories, the abstraction boundaries of the 
          market, emerge from the interaction of entrepreneurs and their potential 
          customers. They emerge from the attempt by entrepreneurs to define what 
          services their products can provide; and the attempt by their customers 
          to express what services they desire. Entrepreneurs orient their actions 
          to existing categories: they mimic current categories by imitation; 
          they modify them by differentiation; and they try to create new ones 
          through innovation. Successful categories, those that persist, reflect 
          not just the action of entrepreneurs, but also the responses of potential 
          customers. Potential customers express their requirements through various 
          means, through negotiation, through novel uses of products, through 
          responses to market research, and ultimately through their purchase 
          or failure to purchase the entrepreneur&rsquo;s offering. The resulting 
          categories become embodied in the design of products, in the design 
          of secondary institutions, and in the grouping of product and institutional 
          types into more general categories that help orient people&rsquo;s actions. 
          Shared categories emerge from the market process of dialogue and exchange.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote25anc" HREF="#sdendnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP>

          Lachmann (1956) presents the function of the entrepreneur as one of 
          combining heterogeneous capital goods into a specific production plan 
          which must fit into a complex capital structure. Lachmann emphasizes 
          both the need to specify a concrete use, and the need to fit the particular

          As we have seen, abstraction boundaries are the key to flexibly combining 
          complementary activities. The process of &lsquo;specifying&rsquo; and 
          &lsquo;fitting&rsquo; requires both the discovery of an abstraction 
          and the creation of a boundary that allows it to connect to complementary 
          activities. Entrepreneurs must look beyond existing categories to specify 
          new solutions, yet at the same time fit the new solution into a pattern 
          of complementary activities. The entrepreneur oriented to the existing 
          categories reads a situation anew, identifies a problem or opportunity, 
          specifies a solution and fits the solution into a complementary web 
          of activity so that the plans of others can be easily reoriented to

        <H3 CLASS="western">Self-reorganization of the market order</H3>
        <P CLASS="western">Entrepreneurs and marketers look beyond existing boundaries 
          to identify commonalities currently hidden behind those boundaries. 
          By creating new distinctions (new abstractions), entrepreneurs are identifying 
          both what should be treated as similar and what should be treated as 
          different. They re-categorize existing shared categories in order to 
          capture overlooked commonalities, or to separate overlooked differences. 
          Entrepreneurs create value by creating new distinctions: where two similar 
          things are being treated as different, there are gains to be had from 
          removing the differences; where two different things are being treated 
          as similar; there are gains to be had from removing the similarities.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Israel Kirzner&rsquo;s (1992) theory of entrepreneurship 
          as arbitrage provides an example of one way that entrepreneurs can capture 
          gains from removing differences. The entrepreneur notices that two similar 
          goods are being treated as if they were different; two instances of 
          the same type of good are selling for two different prices. The alert 
          entrepreneur, by buying low and selling high, can profit from removing 
          this difference. The entrepreneur helps re-categorize the undervalued 
          good by bringing it to the attention of those who value it more.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Arbitrage, however, is not the only source of potential 
          gains from noticing commonalities; recognizing commonalities can also 
          lead to economies of scale and scope. Langlois (1999) argues that economies 
          of scale and scope result primarily from the reuse of knowledge.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote28anc" HREF="#sdendnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
          Economies arise from abstracting out the common aspects of a solution 
          and reusing them across multiple instances. He gives the example of 
          multiplex cinemas: cinema owners gain economies of scale by reusing 
          the services of ticket windows, lobbies, restrooms, snack bars, and 
          management across multiple individual theaters. The common features 
          of stand-alone cinemas were abstracted out, and packaged for reuse by 
          the theatres in the multiplex.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote29anc" HREF="#sdendnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP> 
        </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Gains can also be had by recognizing differences where 
          others see similarities. Fred Smith (2002), for example, when starting 
          Federal Express (now FedEx) recognized that shippers and recipients 
          of small packages differed in the value they placed on the timeliness 
          and reliability of delivery. He recognized that customers who value 
          speed and reliability (for example those who need spare parts to keep 
          expensive capital equipment running) would be willing to pay for guaranteed 
          overnight delivery. Standard approaches to package delivery abstracted 
          from these differences treating them all the same. By looking past the 
          existing boundary, Smith was able to discern differences in why people 
          wanted package delivery services. By identifying a new commonality among 
          these differences (desire for guaranteed overnight deliver), he was 
          able to create a new abstraction boundary defining this new type of 
          service.<SUP><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote30anc" HREF="#sdendnote30sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></SUP></P>
        <P CLASS="western">Just recognizing the new abstraction, however, was 
          not enough. Federal Express had to create new capital combinations, 
          and fit them into an evolving capital structure. Airplanes were purchased 
          and flight routes were organized into a then novel hub-and-spoke configuration. 
          Air delivery was combined with delivery trucks to provide door-to-door 
          service. New interfaces that defined this new type of service were created 
          and marketed to both shippers and receivers of packages. The creation 
          of the new abstraction boundary of overnight delivery required a reconfiguration 
          of the capital structure involved in providing that service. The change 
          in abstraction boundary generated a new structure of cooperating objects 
          involved in providing guaranteed overnight delivery. By hiding these 
          changes from the customers, the abstraction boundary made it easy for 
          customers to adapt their plans. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">As the FedEx example suggests, abstractions boundaries, 
          by virtue of being abstract, provide a source for endogenous change. 
          Abstractions, by emphasizing commonalities and suppressing differences, 
          create opportunities for changing the boundaries. When the differences 
          being hidden are unimportant, there is no incentive to change the boundary; 
          when the differences being hidden start to make a difference, there 
          is an incentive for the boundary to change. An abstraction necessarily 
          hides the diversity of the various instances of the particular type. 
          As long as those differences can be ignored for the purpose at hand, 
          the abstraction boundary will be dynamically maintained by the system. 
          When certain types of purposes and characteristics being hidden behind 
          the abstraction become identifiably important, the abstraction boundaries 
          will need to adapt to accommodate them.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">The pervasiveness of the creation of new abstraction 
          boundaries is illustrated by the role of marketing: marketers look across 
          existing boundaries to better understand the &lsquo;whys&rsquo; of their 
          customers and potential customers. It is marketing's job to identify 
          commonalities that may be hidden behind existing boundaries, and to 
          identify new ways of servicing these commonalities. Marketing theorist, 
          Wroe Alderson (1957), argues that marketing involves trying to match 
          segments of heterogeneous supply to segments of heterogeneous demand. 
          Marketers try to create offerings that provide value to a particular 
          market segment. The market segment identifies a group that shares certain 
          requirements in common despite their underlying diversity. Marketers 
          design new products and services that serve these common needs, while 
          at the same time trying to identify opportunities for further segmentation 
          and differentiation.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Marketers, however, must go beyond the creation of 
          offerings matched to the needs of particular market segments. They must 
          also invest in creating secondary institutions that reduce the costs 
          of transactions. Secondary institutions reduce the transaction costs 
          associated with a type of transaction. Streit and Wegner (1992), also 
          drawing on Lachmann, calls these &lsquo;the sunk costs of transactions.&rsquo; 
          They emphasize that the costs incurred to create an interface for a 
          particular type of transaction are sunk costs from the perspective of 
          a particular transaction occurring through the interface. They write, 
          &lsquo;The costs of making economic agents familiar with institutions 
          become the sunk costs of transactions as soon as the corresponding knowledge 
          is used repeatedly. What remains as a source of current transaction 
          costs is the task of adapting or supplementing the institutional framework 
          to make it fit individual transactions.&rsquo; (1992, p. 138)</P>
        <P CLASS="western">From this perspective, the essential role of marketing 
          is making markets &ndash; both creating a type of product or service, 
          and creating secondary institutions to facilitate transactions of that 
          type. Market institutions provide the customers &lsquo;with readily-usable 
          knowledge about how to make particular classes of transactions.&rsquo; 
          (Loasby, 2000, p. 306) They are attempts to lower the information costs 
          (Dahlman, 1979; Streit and Wegner, 1992) associated with a type of transaction. 
          The particular shape of market abstraction boundaries will be influenced 
          by the nature of those information costs&ndash; the cost of discovering 
          whom to transact with, of informing others of exchange opportunities, 
          of comparing options, of negotiating terms of trade, and of policing 
          and monitoring compliance. Streit and Wegner give the example of negotiation 
          costs: &lsquo;quite a number of internal [secondary] institutions have 
          evolved precisely to reduce this highly uncertain cost component, e.g. 
          standardized contracts, and general conditions of sale.&rsquo; (1992, 
          p. 137) Marketing efforts are investments in creating secondary institutions 
          that generate informational externalities designed to lower the current 
          costs of transactions. Secondary institutions by reducing these costs 
          for a class of transactions remove the need for individuals to incur 
          these costs for each specific transaction. </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Alderson (1957) makes a similar point with his distinction 
          between fully negotiated transactions and routine transactions. Fully 
          negotiated transactions are unique or non-recurring transactions, which 
          involve bilateral negotiations between the parties. Routine transactions 
          are recurring transactions of a particular type: &lsquo;transaction 
          routines apply to classes of transactions that are judged to be essentially 
          similar in their purposes and in the means of carrying them out.&rsquo; 
          (Alderson, 1957, p. 297) With fully negotiated transactions all transaction 
          costs are current; with routine transactions many of the transaction 
          costs are sunk. Investments in secondary institutions reduce the costs 
          of routine transactions; previous marketing activities and institutions 
          replace the need to negotiate every feature of each transaction</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Abstraction boundaries bring the benefits of separation 
          of concerns, but they also provide an incentive for providers to look 
          across the boundary for unmet needs, and an incentive for customers 
          to express needs that are not being met. The potential for gains from 
          reconfiguring the boundaries always exists. The abstraction boundaries 
          are necessary to coordinate actions and to match segments of supply 
          to segments of demand. Yet the essential diversity being hidden behind 
          the abstraction provides an incentive for the discovery of new commonalities, 
          and the creation of new abstraction boundaries to service them. The 
          particular form of market abstraction boundaries will be shaped by the 
          nature of the solution as well as the transaction costs associated with 
          that type of solution. By ignoring the role of entrepreneurs and marketers 
          in creating new products and new secondary institutions, economists 
          do themselves a disservice. They miss an important source of endogenous 
          changes to abstractions and their boundaries. </P>
        <H1 CLASS="western">Conclusion</H1>
        <P CLASS="western">We are embedded in a world of abstraction boundaries; 
          their very familiarity renders them largely invisible. We shop at instances 
          of the type grocery store, we mail letters at instances of the type 
          post office, and we live in instances of the type house purchased through 
          instances of standardized mortgage contracts which are in turn bundled 
          and sold on instances of the type secondary mortgage market. While we 
          always interact with concrete instances, it is the abstract boundary 
          that enables us to coordinate our plans and adapt to changing circumstances. 
        </P>
        <P CLASS="western">Abstraction boundaries represent abstract plans that 
          fill the gap between abstract rules and concrete purposes. The abstraction 
          boundary enforces a separation of concerns: it separates particular 
          implementations of a solution from particular uses of the solutions. 
          Abstraction boundaries convert specific relationships into abstract 
          relationships: they enable the reuse of solutions by multiple clients, 
          and the provision of solutions by multiple providers. By orienting their 
          actions to the abstract plan defined in the boundary, the parties on 
          both sides of the boundaries can more easily coordinate and adapt their 
          particular plans. Abstraction boundaries enhance coordination by making 
          it easier to separate plans where they conflict, and combine them where 
          they complement. By abstracting from the particulars on both sides, 
          boundaries provide a point of stability in the face of change. This 
          abstractness however also provides an incentive for people to look beyond 
          existing boundaries and create new ones that may better serve needs 
          hidden by the boundaries.</P>
        <P CLASS="western">Secondary institutions, understood as abstraction boundaries, 
          play an important but overlooked role in the market process. They are 
          the chief means by which the market classifies knowledge into reusable 
          solutions, and by which the market reduces the costs of reusing the 
          solutions. They enable market participants to make use of a wide range 
          of knowledge without the need to acquire it themselves. As such, they 
          are indispensable for understanding how the market process solves the 
          knowledge problem. Abstraction boundaries are the negotiated categories 
          that emerge from what Lavoie calls the dialogue of the market. From 
          the boundaries of the firm (Langlois 2002) to the emergence of new markets 
          (Loasby 2000), new capital goods (Baetjer 1998), new products (McNulty 
          1984) and new product categories (Lewin 1999), the definition and redefinition 
          of abstraction boundaries permeates the market process. </P>

            extends this critique to non-comprehensive planning. Lavoie (1986),

            Abstraction boundaries enhance productivity by bundling reusable solutions 
            to common problems. The reusable solution embodies a resolved decision: 
            &lsquo;the decision to use an abstraction replaces the decisions resolved 
            by the abstraction. Abstractions increase productivity when the former 
            decisions are more easily resolved than the latter.&rsquo; (Cunningham 
            and Beck, 1989, p. 17) Demsetz describes a similar process occurring 
            in the market: &lsquo;A production process reaches the stage of yielding 
            a salable product when downstream users can work with, or consume, 
            the &lsquo;product&rsquo; without themselves being knowledgeable about 
            its production.&rsquo; (1988, p. 159)</P>

            Hayek (1988, p. 12) explains the nature of abstract rules: &lsquo;What 
            are chiefly responsible for having generated this extraordinary order, 
            and the existence of mankind in its present size and structure, are 
            those rules of human conduct that gradually evolved (especially those 
            dealing with several property, honesty, contract, exchange, trade, 
            competition, gain, and privacy). These rules are handed down by tradition, 
            teaching, and imitation, rather than by instinct, and largely consist 
            of prohibitions (&ldquo;shall not&rsquo;s&rdquo;) that designate adjustable

            We oversimplify to make a point, but this can be misleading. By presenting 
            the creation of the abstraction boundary as the result of a single 
            entrepreneurial act, we are ignoring the interaction between providers, 
            customers, and other interests that shape the evolution of most abstraction 
            boundaries. This is particularly true of the gradual development of 
            the postal system into its current familiar shape. As one commentator 
            notes, &lsquo;Although the basic need for a system to exchange written 
            communications has been felt by all human societies and has been met 
            in many ways, the evolution of varied postal systems adopted by different 
            societies through the centuries into the basically similar pattern 
            of today's state monopoly service has been a long and difficult process.&rsquo;

            Liskov (2002, p. xvii) identifies three steps that programmers use 
            to create abstraction boundary: 1) abstraction - the programmer abstracts 
            a common solution to a recurring problem, 2) specification - the programmer 
            defines a boundary that captures the meaning of the abstraction in 
            terms of the services it provides potential users, and 3) encapsulation 
            &ndash; the programmer hides the details of how the services are to 
            be provided behind the abstraction boundary. </FONT> </P>

            Wirfs-Brock and McKean explain, &lsquo;An interface describes the

            &ldquo;Shine my shoes. Give me my shoes. That&rsquo;ll be five bucks 
            please. Here is your receipt.&rdquo; The interface advertises the

            Type and interface are used by programmers as synonyms for abstraction 
            boundary. They can be seen as emphasizing two related notions of abstraction: 
            interface refers to what an object does abstracted from how it does 
            it; type refers to what kind of object it is abstracted from concrete 
            instances of that type. The two are related because we classify objects 
            based on what services they provide; we classify what an object is, 
            by what the object does. Compare Hayek who writes, </FONT>&lsquo;People 
            behave in the same manner toward things, not because these things 
            are identical in a physical sense, but because they have learned to 
            classify them as belonging to the same group, because they can put 
            them to the same use or expect from them what to the people concerned 
            is an equivalent effect.&rsquo; (<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">1952a

            Lachmann&rsquo;s widening is sometimes referred to as narrowing by 
            software engineers. This apparent contradiction results from different 
            perspectives. For software engineers, the subtype is narrower than 
            the supertype because it is less general: a smaller set of providers 
            provide the more specific functionality of the subtype. For Lachmann 
            the subtype is wider since the new services that are provided by the 
            subtype serve a broader range of client purposes.</FONT></P>

            that embodies the design of the program. The source code is compiled 
            into machine-readable code that is capable of being run on a particular 
            type of computer. The user executes this code when running the program.</FONT></P>

            Software design provides a language for thinking about plan coordination. 
            It provides a set of concepts for reasoning about the problem of dividing 
            and recombining knowledge. This language is much richer than we are 
            able to show here. It also exists in two important senses: 1) as a 
            set of concepts for thinking about these distinctions, and 2) as programming 
            language constructs for implementing these distinctions. As an engineering 
            discipline, software design concepts must pass the empirical test 
            of building better programs. For good overviews of these distinctions 
            see Meyer (1998), Gamma et al (1995), and Liskov (2001). The E programming 
            language (Miller et al, 2000, www.erights.org) is an open source programming 
            language that takes a rights-based approach to problems of plan coordination 
            in programming. </FONT> </P>

            In addition to types and objects, object-oriented programming has 
            the concept of class. A class is a template for creating objects; 
            it implements an object&rsquo;s methods, but not its state. For simplicity, 
            we ignore this distinction in this paper. </FONT> </P>

            The similarity between object and market concepts has been widely 
            recognized by software designers (Miller and Drexler 1988b, Cox 1996, 
            Meyer 1997). For example, Bertrand Meyer writes, <FONT COLOR="#000000">&lsquo;like 
            an economist of the most passionate supply-side, invisible-hand, let-the-free-market 
            decide school, we are interested in individual agents not so much 
            for what they are internally as for what they have to offer to each 
            other ... The economic analogy will indeed accompany us throughout 
            this presentation; the agents &ndash; the software modules &ndash; 
            are called suppliers and clients; the protocols will be called contracts, 
            and much of object-oriented design is indeed <I>Design by Contract</I>.&rsquo;

            Contract in this sense is another name for abstraction boundary, a 
            standardized contract for a type of interaction. Meyer (1997) provides 
            a narrower definition of object contracts which emphasizes the terms 
            and conditions (assertions) required for an object to respond correctly 
            to a particular request. </FONT> </P>

            Gamma et al. caution, &lsquo;Trying to understand one from the other 
            is like trying to understand the dynamism of living ecosystems from

            Articulations, while concrete utterances, are also necessarily abstract. 
            Lavoie (1985a, p. 60) explains, &lsquo;nothing can be completely articulated, 
            since the very process of articulation involves the abstraction from

            Lavoie writes, &lsquo;Entrepreneurship is not an individual act of 
            perception &hellip; it is an interpretive and communicative process 
            involving efforts of different persons to communicate meaning about 
            the future to one another. It is perhaps misleading to even present 
            this coordinating process in terms of the activity of &ldquo;the entrepreneur,&rdquo; 
            the single individual who is more or less alert to opportunities. 
            What we have here is a coordination process that is taking place among 
            persons who are oriented towards the future.&rsquo; (2003, p. 15)</FONT></P>

            Lavoie explains, &lsquo;Lachmann&rsquo;s work <I>Capital and Its Structure</I> 
            depicts the entrepreneur as involved in trying to mesh her plans with 
            those of the ultimate consumers, by in some sense &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; 
            into an evolving structure of capital. This idea of fit is what Lachmann 
            called &ldquo;complementarity.&rdquo; The process of economic production 
            involves the continuous adaptation of heterogeneous parts of the capital 
            structure to one another. It is in this context that he sees the essential 
            role of the entrepreneur as one of figuring out how to specify particular 
            ways of using heterogeneous capital goods that in principle can be 
            used in a multiplicity of alternative ways. Lachmann identifies the 
            key role of the entrepreneur in terms of deciding how to initially 
            select (or later adapt) particular patterns of use of capital goods.&rsquo;

            As Langlois (1999) points out, there is a blurry line between economies 
            of scale and scope: scale economies result from the reuse of knowledge

            of knowledge across many similar units. </FONT> </P>
