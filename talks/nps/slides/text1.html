<h1>MS's 1st Immutable â€œLawâ€?</h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it's not your computer anymore.</h2>
<li><h2>It's an unfortunate fact of computer science: when a computer program runs, it will do what it's programmed to do, even if it's programmed to be harmful.  [...] Once a program is running, it can do anything, <b><i>up to the limits of what you yourself can do</b></i> on the machine.  [...]  It could open every document on the machine, and change the word &quot;will&quot; to &quot;won't&quot; in all of them.  [...]  It could install a virus.  It could create a &quot;back door&quot; that lets someone remotely control your machine. [...]</h2>
<li><h2>That's why it's important to never run, or even download, a program from an untrusted source [...]</h2>
