<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(2)">Why is the Knowledge Economy&#10;so Wealthy?</a><br><ul><li>Despite burst bubbles, boom is real
<ul><li>Last 20 years: productivity +66%, GDP +60% (approx)
<ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Q: Wealth of Nations?  
<li>A: Plan coordination
<ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Entrepreneurs craft plans to realize opportunities
<ul><li>But from what signals?  Not price alone!
</ul></ul><li>Markets are extended conversations
<ul><li>Both prices and linguistic expressions
<li>All actors use and produce both
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(3)">What we are &amp; aren&#146;t saying</a><br><ul><li>&#147;The point here is not to resolve the empirical question [&#133;] but to elaborate upon the theory of entrepreneurship to emphasize its relevance for such empirical investigations&#148;
</ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(4)">Entrepreneurship as&#10;Mutual Orientation</a><br><ul><li>Entrepreneurs <i>orient</i> to other&#146;s understandings
<ul><li>and often aid others in orienting to theirs
<li>so their plans may mutually adapt.
</ul></ul><li>Institutions: Superindividual schemes of thought
<ul><li>Structures for mutual orientation of human action
<ul><li>organizations, law, language, money, prices, &#133;
<li>regularized practices: accounting, mailboxes, &#133;
</ul></ul></ul><li>Entrepreneur<i>ship</i> coordinates plans further
<ul><li>by selective fitness of better market interpreters
<li>by creating new ways of interpreting
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(5)">Orientation is Inter-Subjective</a><br><ul><li>Philosophy101 &#147;Subjectivism&#148; is inward looking
<ul><li>Relativism, Solipsism, Introspection, Inner Thoughts, Dreams
<li>Such a subjectivist is an island
</ul></ul><li>Austrian (Inter-)Subjectivism is outward looking
<ul><li>(But the term &amp; the Austrian literature invites confusion.)
<li>Polycentric: We each work to partially understand and value the world and each other, but each starting from and in service of our own unique endowment of knowledge, situation, relationships, purposes, atitudes, and aptitudes.
<li>Meanings in external linguistic articulations
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(6)">Two Visions of Entrepreneurship</a><br><ul><li><u>Seeing</u> opportunity others missed.
<li><i>vs</i>
<li><u>Explaining</u> what they mean
<ul><li>to their suppliers, customers, co-workers, investors.
<li>&#147;<i>This is what I want. This is what I can do. This is how I could pay.</i>&#148;
</ul></ul><li>Division &amp; Composition of Knowledge &amp; Labor
<ul><li>Sense-making where separate purposes/perspectives meet.
<li>Greatly aided by &#147;instruments of interpretation&#148;:&#10;Content used through reader-purpose colored glasses.&#10;Early example: Scroll <i>vs</i> bound book.
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(7)">Capital and/as&#10;Structured Linguistic Media </a><br><ul><li>Valued based on imputed meaning / purpose
<ul><li>Substance alone is meaningless (ink, scrap metal)
<li>Heterogeneity, complementarity, context, structure
<li>Persistent articulation of knowledge
<li>As it&#146;s revised/adapted, it &#147;learns&#148;: &#10;Knowledge embodied <i>in the artifact</i> grows
<ul></ul></ul></ul><li>&#147;Lengthening&#148;, Complexification, Differentiation
<ul><li>Division &amp; composition of knowledge &amp; &#147;labor&#148; &#10;advance for capital and media as well.
<li>Not just more pieces.  Better abstraction boundaries,&#10;More modular pieces, More complex arrangements.
<ul></ul></ul></ul><li><i>The complexification of capital is limited by the extent of orientability</i>
</ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(8)">History of the Verbal</a><br><ul><li>Pre-Literate Societies
<ul><li>The verbal had to do &#147;everything&#148;
<li>Huge emphasis on memorization
<ul><li>Rhyme, Cadence, Song, Storytelling
</ul><li>Intergenerational transmission of complex knowhow
<li>Cultural learning overtook genetic learning
<li><i>Enabled markets!</i>
</ul></ul><li>With the Rise of the Written
<ul><li>The verbal specialized on its relative strengths
</ul></ul><li>Pre-digital electronic media amplified voice, not text
<ul><li>Phono, Tape Recorder, Phone, Radio, TV, VCR
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(9)">History of the Written</a><br><ul><li>Writing&#146;s first killer app:
<ul><li>Growing the extent of the market.
<li>More than 90% of Babylonian Cuneiform are acct. records
<li>Identification of goods, of owner, types &amp; quantities
<li>Law, contracts, money, &#133;
</ul></ul><li>Milestones
<ul><li>Hieroglyphic -&gt; Alphabetic: Indexable
<li>Scrolls -&gt; Books:  Linear <i>vs</i> random access.
<li>It took a herd to make a book -&gt; Paper production
<li>Gutenberg: circulating multiple copies
<li>Fidelity -&gt; Reader convenience -&gt; Complex structuring
</ul></ul><li>Utterly transformed civilization
<ul><li>Markets, inquiry, thinking, technology, &#133;
</ul></ul></ul></p>

<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(11)">Poles of a Rich Cross-Fertilization</a><br></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(12)">Hypertext:&#10;Adaptively-Structured Knowledge</a><br><ul><li>Intertextual: Emphasis on teaching the text to teach.
<li>Navigations structures
<ul><li>as seriously authored as content, as a carrier of meaning
<li>Author doesn't design &quot;an experience&quot; (scrolls, movies) &#10;but rather provides readers means to craft their own
<li>Readers craft according to their own unique endowment of knowledge, situation, relationships, purposes, atitudes, and aptitudes.
<li>Economics of clicking: Readers craft across sites.&#10;Further escape from the scroll
<li>Reader/authors construct new orienting views over other's content
</ul></ul><li>&quot;Conversation&quot; with text is now actual conversation
</ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(13)">Groupware:&#10;Persistent Conversations</a><br><ul><li>Interpersonal: Collaboration with known others
<ul><li>Emergent understanding within a largely tacit context,&#10;but with articulation help (eg, shared whiteboards)
<li>Permanent record of conversation a <i>secondary</i> benefit
</ul></ul><li>Intertemporal, Interspatial: escaping limits
<ul><li>Interspatial needn't be interesting
<li>Differing treatments of time create radically differing media
<ul><li>ICQ, email, passing the chalk, version control
</ul></ul></ul><li>Mixing it up:
<ul><li>Making all these advantages accessible together
<li>By integration (Notes), or by composition (SourceForge)
</ul></ul></ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(14)">Example: Adaptive Email Views</a><br></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(15)">Example: Hayekian Hyperpaths</a><br><ul><li>For jointly editable group website &#147;knowledge base&#148;
<li>Best practices convention, spread by word of mouth
<ul><li>&#147;If you&#146;re looking for doc T, and you first try to find the link on doc S but it&#146;s not there, once you do find T, edit S to link to T.&#148;
</ul></ul><li>Intended (or at least expected) consequence: 
<ul><li>You and others on similar quests later will have an easier trip.
<li>Orientation emergent from many small orienting utterances.
</ul></ul><li>Unintended consequence: 
<ul><li>Others ignorant of T but interested in S will discover T.
</ul></ul><li>The invisible hand sometimes holds a pen.
</ul></p>
<p align=left><a href="JavaScript:parent.NavigateAbs(16)">Mutual Orientation &amp; Wealth</a><br><ul><li>Markets are extended systems of cooperation
<ul><li>Cooperation requires coordination
<li>Coordination requires prices + mutual orientation:
<li>Working to <i>partially</i> understand &amp; be understood.
<ul><li>Full understanding would lose advantage of division of knowledge
</ul><li>Linguistic expression is the great tool of mutual orientation
</ul></ul><li>Linguistic media amplify power of process
<ul><li>Allow authors &amp; readers to collaborate on construction of process of mutual understandability
</ul></ul><li>Vastly greater plan coordination abilities
<ul><li>create economy whose plans are generally more coordinated
<li>and form richer structures, that can produce richer outputs.
