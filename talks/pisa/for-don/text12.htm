<li><h2>Navigations structures</h2>
<ul><li>as seriously authored as content, as a carrier of meaning
<li>Author doesn't design &quot;an experience&quot; (scrolls, movies) &#10;but rather provides readers means to craft their own
<li>Readers craft according to their own unique endowment of knowledge, situation, relationships, purposes, atitudes, and aptitudes.
<li>Economics of clicking: Readers craft across sites.&#10;Further escape from the scroll
<li>Reader/authors construct new orienting views over other's content
