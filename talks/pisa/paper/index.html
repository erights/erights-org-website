      <h1><a name="abstract"></a>Abstract</h1>
      <p>Inadequate and ill-adapted property institutions in the third world prevent 
        the extralegal assets of the poor from serving as capital. In particular, 
        the absence of credible systems of title transfer makes real estate holdings 
        ineffective as collateral for loans. How can this barrier to wealth creation 
        be surmounted? Country-by-country institutional reform is possible, but 
        inevitably slow. New options based on computer networks and trusted computational 
        agents may provide a shorter path. By leveraging trust in first-world 
        institutions while enabling the evolution of contractual arrangements 
        that fit local needs and traditions, this approach could bring advanced 
        property systems to regions now paralyzed by their absence.</p>
      <h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hernando de Soto, in <i>The Mystery of Capital</i> [<a href="#deSoto00">deSoto00</a>], 
        shows that the poor of the world have, in his terminology, <i>assets</i> 
        vastly in excess of their <i>capital</i>. In one study, de Soto's associates 
        surveyed neighborhoods in various poor countries, assessing the value 
        of buildings which were not formally titled. The extrapolated value of 
        just the informally owned buildings in the third world amounted to $9.3 
        trillion -- more than half the combined value of all publicly traded U.S. 
        companies. In identifying a crucial mystery -- the failure of these assets 
        to serve as capital for their owners -- de Soto has identified a great 
        opportunity for economic betterment.</p>
      <p> De Soto's focus is on the <i>informal</i> sector -- that sphere of economic 
        activity that occurs outside the official <i>formal</i> legal system. 
        Most of the economic activity of the third world's poor occurs in the 
        informal sector. Despite the non-official status of the informal systems 
        of laws and property in this sector, they are nevertheless quite real, 
        and form the foundations on which these informal economies function. However, 
        the formal and informal sectors are not otherwise equivalent. The poor 
        pay a great price for informality -- most of all in the difficulty of 
        capital formation.</p>
      <p>As a simple example, the house you live in, from which no one would attempt 
        to evict you, is an asset. The recognition and sense of legitimacy in 
        your local community of your claim to the house makes this asset effectively 
        your property. A mortgage on that house would be capital. (In countries 
        that have become rich, mortgages in particular have been a major source 
        of highly decentralized investment, seeding many family businesses.) But 
        just because no one can evict you from your house, this does not mean 
        a bank dares accept it as collateral for a loan. The distinction is one 
        of <i>credibility of property rights transfer at a distance</i>, i.e., 
        the ability to engage in binding contracts such that the new owners could 
        be confident they could indeed evict you as part of the contract, despite 
        their distance from your community.</p>
      <p>De Soto hopes to bring the power of capital to the poor by strengthening 
        their property rights in accord with historical precedents in the advanced 
        economies -- that is, by reforming and extending the legal systems and 
        bureaucracies of their various national governments. This is no easy task: 
        the benefits of reform flow to the now-marginalized property owners, but 
        the benefits of inertia rest with the power holders. De Soto argues powerfully 
        that property-system reform should be a primary political objective, and 
        we concur.</p>
      <p>This paper, however, explores another path to de Soto's objective, one 
        opened by new technologies of the Net. Given the exponential rate at which 
        the cost of electronics and wireless communications are falling, the cost 
        of the technology itself should rapidly become a non-issue, even for the 
        world's poorest. Because binding contracts for ownership transfer lie 
        at the heart of capital formation, what if traditional contracts were 
        supplemented and/or supplanted with <i>smart contracts</i>? Smart contracts 
        will enable cooperation among mutually suspicious parties, often without 
        need for legal recourse. Could such a jurisdiction-free contracting mechanism, 
        accessible over the Net, dramatically increase capital liquidity, spawning 
        a flood of new wealth in the poorest areas of the world? </p>
      <h3><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h3>
      <p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Networks of Trust</b> synthesizes ideas from de Soto and Francis 
          Fukuyama to suggest the strong role played by widely trusted intermediary 
          institutions, or <i>trust hubs</i>, in forming working large-scale trust 
          networks, especially the institutions of title and law. We explain de 
          Soto's program, which we call <i>the governmental path</i>, to address 
          the absence of these institutions by bringing the informals into governmental 
          systems of formal law and property. We make explicit the conflict faced 
          on this path between <i>local knowledge</i> and <i>global transferability</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>We propose an alternate jurisdiction-free <i>digital path</i>, made 
          possible by new technologies, that could leverage the existing wide 
          recognition of first world institutions to short circuit the slow growth 
          process of the other paths.</p>
        <p><b>Smart Contracts</b> are contracts as program code, where the terms 
          of the contract are enforced by the logic of the program's execution. 
          In a series of steps, from the basic metaphor of <i>contracts as board 
          games</i>, through the nature of contract-created <i>derivative rights</i>, 
          to <i>compositions of games</i> to turn assets into capital, we explain 
          how smart contracts can resolve the conflict -- gaining the benefits 
          of global transferability without sacrificing local knowledge.</p>
        <p><b>Backing and Legitimacy</b>. Why would a change of electronic title 
          be locally honored as a transfer of control of the actual assets? The 
          governmental path provides backing by coercive enforcement. How may 
          the non-coercive digital path address these issues instead? By <i>ratings</i> 
          -- independent estimates of the likelihood that a title listing would 
          be honored; like credit reports for systems of local law. And by <i>video 
          contracts</i> to bridge between the above abstract world and local systems 
          of largely unwritten arrangements. An example shows how the outcome 
          of a smart contract may gain local legitimacy. </p>
        <p><b>Limitations and Hazards</b>. What other novel problems will we encounter 
          on the digital path? First, smart contracts will be<i> unable to express</i> 
          the subtle richness of contracts written in natural language, leading 
          to techniques for combining the two kinds of contract elements into 
          <i>split contracts</i>. Second, a naively deployed smart contract system 
          could exacerbate rather than diminish the dangers of <i>regulatory capture</i> 
          -- the participants could end up with less vulnerability to local governments 
          but more vulnerability to distant governments, over which they exert 
          even less influence. This section explains how both of these problems 
          may be addressed. </p>
        <p>Being untested, we can be sure the digital path will encounter further 
          problems, indeed more problems than we can anticipate. This section 
          just scratches the surface.</p>
        <p><b>Why the Third World First?</b> Why may the third world lead the 
          first in the transition to smart contract mediated global commerce? 
          Because of differences in the nature of <i>legitimacy</i> in these two 
          worlds.<b> </b>Because the first world has already paid the <i>homogenization 
          costs</i> -- it has already lost the diversity the digital path could 
          have preserved. And because the third world lacks a working <i>installed 
          base</i> of law and property, which could lead to the leapfrogging seen 
          with cell phones in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Besides being first through this transition, the third world's success 
          may cause the first world to follow along.</p>
        <p><b> The Rule of Law and Not of Men</b>. In one respect at least, the 
          character of life on the digital path may be more familiar to the past 
          than the present. It would be an almost literal realization of the classical 
          liberal ideal.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h1><a name="nohubs"></a>Networks of Trust</h1>
      <p>Why are some societies so much better able to generate wealth than others? 
        During the great oppressions of the twentieth century, many people, including 
        ourselves, held the naive view that once oppression was out of the way, 
        markets would bloom and take care of the people. This has proven tragically 
        wrong. The years since then have shown that the absence of oppression 
        was not enough. Free speech was not enough. The end of socialism was not 
        enough. The universal desire for capitalism was not enough. In order to 
        successfully help, we must first solve this riddle. Many people have tried, 
        and the answers proposed by Hernando de Soto and Francis Fukuyama are 
        especially insightful and complementary.</p>
      <p>Fukuyama's <i>Trust</i> [<a href="#Fukuyama95">Fukuyama95</a>] makes 
        many perceptive observations of how the world's <i>cultures</i> differ 
        regarding attitudes and proclivities towards trust -- how easily, and 
        under what conditions, members of a particular culture come to trust each 
        other. In the <i>high trust </i> societies, mutually trusting relationships 
        are easily formed. In <i>low trust </i>societies they are not. In Fukuyama's 
        taxonomy, the third major category, <i>familial trust </i>societies (or 
        Confucian societies), is not between the other two on a spectrum. Rather, 
        it is a different stable pattern characterized by dense networks of high 
        trust within families, but rather low trust between families. Fukuyama 
        shows how these different patterns of trust seem to explain some of the 
        observed differences in the patterns of businesses that arise in these 
        cultures. Complex cooperative arrangements require trust, so not surprisingly, 
        Fukuyama's high trust societies are the ones best able to generate vast 
        amounts of wealth.</p>
      <p>But to understand the success of the first world requires something more 
        than Fukuyama's analysis. No matter what the culture, simple cognitive 
        limitations prevent any of us from knowing, much less trusting, more than 
        a very small fraction of the members of our societies [<a href="#Hayek37">Hayek37</a>]. 
        Nevertheless, in the first world massive numbers of strangers meet, trade, 
        do business, negotiate, and sign contracts, despite lack of any prior 
        knowledge of, or reasons to trust in, each other. How is this possible?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>De Soto's earlier book, <i>The Other Path</i> [<a href="#deSoto89">deSoto89</a>], 
        tells a complementary story. De Soto can also be understood as explaining 
        differences in economic organization according to differences in the possibilities 
        for trust. However, de Soto's emphasis is not culture but institutions, 
        and their lack. De Soto's portrayal of the poor within a third world village 
        is not one of culturally-based low trust. Rather, it is the painful lack 
        of the various widely trusted intermediary institutions that catalyze 
        commerce at a distance, and that we normally take for granted in the first 
        world.</p>
      <p><b><img src="images/1-hubs.gif" width="347" height="212" align="right"></b>Trust 
        relationships can be thought of as analogous to the airport hub and spoke 
        pattern. (Figure 1). Many small local networks are interconnected on a 
        wider scale through major hubs. Although this pattern is a partial centralization, 
        it is not a hierarchy -- there is, for example, no central hub of hubs. 
        Logically, it is peer to peer, but it is built with a backbone architecture 
        due to the economics of the system. The Net itself has mostly the same 
        architecture, as does the highway system. In all cases, a sparsely connected 
        actual network acts for most purposes like a densely connected network. 
        For example, from any airport you can fly to any other airport, almost 
        as if there were flights between every pair of airports. For many purposes, 
        it acts like the network shown on the right.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in the first world, two strangers can meet and conduct business 
        as if they had prior knowledge of and trust in each other, by virtue of 
        their reliance on a mutually recognizing backbone of widely trusted intermediary 
        institutions, or <i>trust hubs</i>. These hubs are in the business of 
        securing these relationships to minimize the risks their customers face 
        from each other; this often requires them to absorb some of these risk 
        onto themselves. The economies of scale available to a hub can help tremendously 
        with these risks. Historically, western societies have developed specialized 
        hubs that bundle trust with other expertise: one trusts Citibank not only 
        because Citibank has a demonstrated history of reliably backing their 
        loans, but also because they are experts in loan and risk management, 
        which are necessary elements of reliability in that field: an organization 
        that attempted to engage in banking without expertise in these fields 
        could not be trustworthy no matter how honorable the employees and executives 
        of the organization might be.</p>
      <p>Other examples of familiar trust hubs include title companies, insurance, 
        escrow, exchanges and auction houses, underwriters, Consumer Reports, 
        Roger Ebert, notaries, arbiters, courts and cops, money, etc... The list 
        is endless. </p>
      <p><img src="images/2-low-trust.gif" width="350" height="218" align="right">From 
        a simple graph-theoretic point of view (inspired by [<a href="#Granovetter73">Granovetter73</a>, 
        <a href="#London97" target="_top">London97</a>]), we can analyze the Fukuyama 
        low-trust world (in which the fanout from each node is small) and the 
        de Soto missing-hub world, and immediately recognize which effect has 
        the greater impact on a society's effectiveness: it is the absence of 
        the hubs that ultimately prevents large scale complex cooperative arrangements 
        from forming. Even with high cultural proclivity for individual-to-individual 
        trust, in the absence of hubs, the resulting virtual network would at 
        best form small islands of densely connected networks, only loosely connected 
        to each other. The resulting picture resembles both Fukuyama's portrayal 
        of familial trust societies, and de Soto's portrayal of networks of villages 
        of informals.</p>

      <p>The virtual network of Figure 1 forms one large market with great extent, 
        enabling a great division of knowledge and labor. The virtual network 
        of Figure 2 is one of many separate markets, barely connected to each 
        other, and each individually of minor extent.</p>
      <p>But shouldn't this situation be an ideal growth medium for hubs? If there 
        is great market need for them, then surely there is great demand and great 
        opportunity. Indeed, this is the situation from which the hub backbone 
        grew spontaneously in the West. Absent government oppression we should 
        indeed expect it to grow here as well. However, the West's backbone of 
        hubs are the result of slow growth processes; they build slowly over time. 
        The widespread trust needed by these institutions can be seen as a form 
        of capital that takes a long time to accumulate. </p>
      <p>One of the depressing features of the pictures painted by both Fukuyama 
        and de Soto is that the only hope they see for these societies is homegrown, 
        with each individual third world nation bootstrapping itself through all 
        these steps, including, for de Soto, the evolution of their own hubs; 
        or the reform and transformation of each society's national government 
        into a system that may be widely trusted. Well, it took a long time for 
        the West. If they must recapitulate our path, it will take them a long 
        time as well, a time during which desperate poverty will remorselessly 
        prevail. What enablers are available now that were unavailable when the 
        West made this transition? Might these enablers be used to help accelerate 
        today's poor through this part of the process of capital formation?</p>
      <h3><a name="title"></a>The Special Roles of Title and Law</h3>
      <p>In <i>The Other Path</i>, de Soto explained the informal economy and 
        its lack of institutions in general. Eleven years later, after much investigation 
        both of the phenomenon of persistent poverty, and an extraordinary uncovering 
        of the history of how the West overcame these problems, in <i>The Mystery 
        of Capital</i> de Soto has narrowed his focus to the crucial role played 
        by the institution of title transfer.</p>
      <p>While all these hubs are valuable for the formation of wealth creating 
        societies, not all are equally crucial. De Soto's analysis suggests that 
        the institutions most needed to get the ball rolling, and which are most 
        painfully absent in the informal sectors of the third world, are credible 
        systems of title transfer. It is through widely trusted title registries 
        that banks can become confident that the collateral against which they 
        make a loan will indeed become theirs in the event of default. This requires 
        not just trust in the title company itself, but credibility that a transfer 
        of title on the books will be honored as a transfer of ownership in reality. 
        Title registries with this level of credibility enable <i>rights transfer 
        at a distance</i>: people who have never met one another and probably 
        never will can engage in asset transfers and capital formation with the 
        confidence that they will acquire the goods specified in the contract.</p>
      <p>Although de Soto documents the creation of extralegal title companies 
        in the informal sector, these do not currently seem able to provide the 
        credibility at a distance needed for this transition.</p>
      <h3><a name="govt"></a>The Governmental Path</h3>
      <p>Among currently existing choices, perhaps the only organizations that 
        can fill this crucial titling role in a nation are formal ones backed 
        by government itself. A government bundles together widespread recognition, 
        some sense of legitimacy, and powers of enforcement. This is the strategy 
        de Soto has adopted, converting extralegal assets, village by village, 
        into officially acknowledged parts of the formal economy. The strategy 
        has been wildly successful in bringing the poor into the modern world. 
        Working with the government of Peru, over four years, de Soto's organization 
        helped a quarter of a million people formalize many of their assets, creating 
        new capital, and producing $2.1 billion of new tax revenues for the government 
        of Peru. One may hope and expect that these demonstrated tax revenues, 
        if nothing else, will tempt other governments to follow suit.</p>
      <p>De Soto's isn't the first attempt to title the informals' property and 
        bring them into the formal sector, but it is the first such attempt in 
        the third world to work on a large scale. De Soto documents previous well 
        intentioned efforts, with surveyors, geographic information systems, interviews 
        of informals to ascertain who owns what, and formal title registries backed 
        by the formal legal system -- all the obviously necessary ingredients. 
        Why did these previous attempts all fail? </p>
      <p>Because the formals did not appreciate that the informals already had 
        worked out systems of law, rights, and obligations, negotiated over time 
        and idiosyncratic village by village. These systems are sometimes called 
        <i>the people's law</i>. Instead, the formals' approach to the situation 
        was <i>We have a legal system. You don't. Here's ours. </i>Although the 
        title listings reflected a snapshot of who-owns-what, the legal system 
        governing these title listings did nothing to reflect the complex informally 
        negotiated arrangements needed to understand what rights someone actually 
        held to a particular asset. Given this mismatch, the informals proceeded 
        to ignore the formal title registries and trade assets in the way they 
        always had. The title registries were not updated to reflect changes of 
        actual ownership, and so rapidly became even more irrelevant. De Soto's 
        special insight in this situation has been that the government must discover 
        and respect the local laws, and work out, at considerable cost in time 
        and effort, a way to integrate those local laws with the national systems.</p>
      <h3><a name="conflict"></a>The Conflict: Local Knowledge <i>vs. </i>Global 
        Transferability</h3>
      <p> The difficulty comes from an inherent conflict between <i>local knowledge</i> 
        and <i>global transferability</i> -- local knowledge of the idiosyncratic 
        people's law, conventions, and negotiated arrangements in force in each 
        village, <i>vs.</i> the need to move the governance of title transfer 
        to hubs, whose wide scope would seem to require them to operate from a 
        more homogenized set of rules. This tension is acute on the governmental 
        path, as the homogenized set of rules is not even per title company, but 
        is rather the official legal system itself. Governmental legal systems 
        are hardly the wonders of adaptability de Soto's program would seem to 
        require. Even with the best of intentions, an accommodation between the 
        two must rapidly turn into a Procrustean bed. However, de Soto offers 
        no alternative. Though difficult, he is somehow successfully making this 
        path work, and he documents how it did work when formal U.S. law, slowly 
        and painfully, absorbed the informal wild west.</p>
      <p>As if this path were not difficult enough, this whole process faces enormous 
        obstacles from many different factions, notably bureaucracies and lawyers 
        within the national sphere that see this as an assault on their prerogatives, 
        as de Soto also documents. The process never becomes easy: each step of 
        progress is another major upheaval in the perceptions and preferences 
        of entrenched groups dedicated to protecting the status quo.</p>

        to the Net, purely electronic goods and services can now be purchased 
        from across the world as easily as from next door. Consumers of these 
        goods and services have already escaped old limits of geography and jurisdiction 
        [<a href="#Johnson96">Johnson96</a>]. If the functions normally provided 
        by trust hubs were offered by well-known first world trust hubs as purely 
        electronic services, those in need of such widely trusted intermediary 
        services could escape as well -- escape from the crushing assumption that 
        such services can only be provided by institutions backed by their own 
        governments. Instead, they could reach across the Net to use these services, 
        and begin to bootstrap themselves out of their poverty by participating 
        in the global networks of commerce. (Figure 3) </font></p>
      <p>Many first world trust hubs are already widely known and plausibly trusted 
        in the third world because of the pervasive spread of western media: shows 
        ranging from CNN to Dallas and Baywatch have granted name recognition 
        and an aura of respectability to first world organizations that most governments 
        can only envy. (However one may feel about this process, it is occurring, 
        so we may as well put it to good use.) Using first world hubs, villages 
        on a global scale could become part of a global trust network. For example, 
        if a person in village A wants to sell a tractor to a person in village 
        D, a couple of villages away, they could easily use a title registry run 
        by Citibank in New York to execute the transfer. In a similar fashion, 
        the tractor may be securitized, transforming it into capital. And in a 
        state such as Russia, a title listing with Citibank would, ironically, 
        have more legitimacy <i>because</i> the titling institution is beyond 
        the reach of their own government.</p>
      <p>O<font color="#000000">nce the villages of the world join this global 
        village, it will be much easier for them to grow their own high-trust

        by hubs that are already widely trusted. With a working trust backbone, 
        highly trustworthy behavior gets the visibility it needs to more rapidly 
        accumulate its own reputation-capital. </font></p>
      <h1><font color="#000000"><a name="smart-contracts"></a>Smart Contracts</font></h1>
      <p>How might such hubs deal with the idiosyncrasies of each village's <i>people's 
        law</i> -- the idiosyncrasies that sabotage traditional governmental attempts 
        to capitalize village assets -- without taking on the impossible burden 
        of learning all this local knowledge itself, and without imposing the 
        costs of homogenization? By the use of smart contracts.</p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In smart contracts, a software program is the operational 
        embodiment of a contract [<a href="#Szabo97">Szabo97</a>], where the program's 
        behavior enforces the terms of the contract, or at least raises the cost 
        of violating the contract. Szabo introduces the concept with the example 
        of a drink vending machine. A drink vending machine is a very primitive 
        example of a smart contract being executed on a contract host -- the vending 
        software executing on the vending machine hardware. This combination of 
        contract and contract host is a partially trusted intermediary between 
        the drink manufacturer and the purchaser. It escrows drinks and money, 
        and performs an exchange of those goods when both have been presented. 
        There is even a rollback process, in which it returns the money if the 
        drink cannot be delivered. Traditional contracts are understood to be 
        backed by a coercive enforcement system made of courts and cops. However, 
        the vending machine does not have the option of such recourse following 
        a breach. In what sense is it a contract?</font></p>
      <p>The vending-machine-as-contract would indeed require separate enforcement 
        if it dispensed the drink first and then demanded payment. However, by 
        escrowing both drinks and payment before dispensing either, it also dispenses 
        with the need for separate enforcement. Instead of enforcement, the contract 
        creates an <i>inescapable arrangement</i>. It cannot prevent the customer 
        from walking away before the game is over, but a customer who walks away 
        from a contract in progress leaves behind any assets escrowed by the contract 
        at that point [<font color="#000000"><a href="#Miller00">Miller00</a>]</font>. 
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">(The vending machine is partially and asymmetrically 
        trusted, as both parties know that it is ultimately an agent only of the 
        drink manufacturer. Other smart contract scenarios involve more symmetric 
        mutually trusted third parties.)</font></p>
      <p>Although conventional coercive recourse is still often possible on the 
        Net, for more and more Net commerce these costs are too great, and the 
        jurisdictional issues potentially too messy. Instead, Net businesses have 
        been engaging in rich and rapid experimentation with cooperative arrangements 
        that require no coercive recourse [<a href="#Krecke01">Krecke01</a>]. 
        The most common arrangements involve not actual escrow, but reputation 
        feedback and credit [<a href="#Friedman00">Friedman00</a>, <a href="#Steckbeck01">Steckbeck01</a>]. 
        This has a similar logic, in that a participant effectively secures their 
        good performance with the value of their reputation capital. Such arrangements 
        are messier and less amenable to automation than escrow, but they do substantially 
        reduce capital costs. Both kinds of arrangements have their place and 
        will compete in the market. In this paper we explore escrow-based smart 
        contracts, not because we expect this form to dominate, but because their 
        logic is vastly easier to explain; because they are easier to build, and 
        so will occur sooner; and most of all because they apply to participants 
        with no prior reputation, which helps lower barriers to entry. Likewise, 
        for the electronic systems of title (called <i>issuers</i> below), in 
        this paper we assume systems that provide for instant settlement [<a href="#e-gold">e-gold</a>]. 
        Although delayed settlement may substantially reduce capital costs [<a href="#Selgin01" target="_top">Selgin01</a>], 
        they would turn smart contracts into explosions of complexity.</p>
      <h3><font color="#000000"><img src="images/4-exchange.gif" width="390" height="266" align="right"></font>Contracts 
        as Games</h3>
      <p><font color="#000000">A basic metaphor for smart contracts is the board 
        game. When two people negotiate a contract, they are jointly designing 
        the rules of a game they would both be willing to play. Once they commit 
        to playing this game, the players may then make moves, but only moves 
        judged legal by the rules given the current board state. Each move potentially 
        changes the board state, changing which moves are legal during the next 
        turn.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">For example, Figure 4 shows the six possible board 
        states of a simple negotiation and exchange game [<a href="#Amix91">Amix91</a>]. 
        Let's say Alice is playing the left side of the board and Bob the right. 
        In the initial board state, A, neither of the pieces is on the board. 
        The gold bar, representing money, is off the board on the left, which 
        portrays its possession by Alice at this time. For concreteness, let's 
        say the knight represents stock. Bob might offer a certain amount of stock 
        to Alice by placing it on the right square of the board, taking us to 
        board state B. Alice might not respond soon enough, in which case Bob 
        may withdraw his offer by taking back the knight, bringing us back to 
        state A. That's why the first transition arrow is shown as bi-directional.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Or Alice may respond to Bob's offer with a certain 
        amount of money, by placing it on the left square of the board, taking 
        us to state D. At this point, either party may still decide they're unsatisfied, 
        withdraw their piece, and reenter the loop of bi-directional arrows (at 
        B or C). Or, while in board state D, Bob may pick up the money offered 
        by Alice, accepting Alice's offer. This is the irreversible commitment 
        step shown by the bold unidirectional arrow, and takes us to state E. 
        From here, the only possible move is for Alice to pick up Bob's knight, 
        leaving the game in terminal state F.</font></p>
      <p>How is this contract self enforcing? What prevents cheating? Who needs 
        to trust whom with what? To answer these questions, we must start by explaining 
        what is happening on whose computer. We assume that each player trusts 
        their own computer (a dangerous assumption, but we cannot proceed without 
        it). We also assume that player X cannot trust player Y's computer any 
        more or less than they trust player Y. Under these assumptions, we can 
        treat a computer and its proprietor as a single unit for purposes of analysis.</p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><img src="images/5-duties.gif" width="297" height="299" align="right">The 
        execution of this game actually involves five parties, as illustrated 
        in Figure 5. The two players of course, Alice and Bob. The contract host 
        serves the same role as our vending machine -- it is the third party mutually 
        trusted to execute the contract/program faithfully. The contract can be 
        any program Alice and Bob mutually agree on, written to run on a <i>capability 
        system</i> -- a secure programming language or operating system suitable 
        for writing smart contracts [<a href="#Miller00">Miller00</a>]. This contract/program 
        functions as the <i>board manager</i> for the game they have agreed to 
        play. (For example, a <i>board manager</i> for chess is a program that 
        enables two people to play with each other, maintains the board state, 
        and only allows legal moves. A board manager does not itself play the 
        game.)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Unlike the vending machine, the contract host need 
        not have any prior knowledge of the contract.</font> Once Alice and Bob 
        agree on the text of a board manager and on a mutually trusted contract 
        host, they upload the board manager to the contract host, which then verifies 
        for them that they've agreed on the same contract, and dispenses to each 
        the right to play their respective sides of the game. These rights are 
        shown as the arrows pointing at the respective chairs. The contract can 
        embody the knowledge of acceptable arrangements local to Alice and Bob, 
        local custom, prior handshakes, etc., limited only by what Alice and Bob 
        can agree on, and what they can manage to express in this new medium. 
        To the extent the contract host can be trusted at all, it can be trusted 
        to run this contract faithfully, despite its ignorance of the local knowledge 
        that gives this contract meaning. This is the first step in resolving 
        the conflict between local knowledge and global transferability.</p>
      <p>(Telling the tale this way hides a further division of labor. Most players 
        will not program up their own custom contract, but will instead select 
        a &quot;boilerplate&quot; contract/program off the shelf and fill in the 
        blanks. These customizable contracts may have been contributed by earlier 
        players who did write their own contract, or they may be created by specialists, 
        either speculatively or for hire. Or perhaps they will use a simplified 
        contract construction kit, whose user interface might resemble a drawing 
        package specialized for drawing our board-state-transition diagrams. Such 
        an interface may even enable some players to overcome hurdles of language 
        and literacy. In any case, the simplified story of the custom contract 
        still shows well the logic by which the system operates, without needing 
        to speculate on the possible organization of the market for smart contract 
        creation.)</p>
      <p>The two remaining players, the &quot;$-Issuer&quot; and the &quot;Stock-Issuer&quot;, 
        transform the movement of pieces into a transfer of <i>third-party-assayable 
        transferable electronic rights</i>, or <i>erights</i>. A $-Issuer, or 
        more conventionally a bank, is effectively a title company for money. 
        For money on record at the bank, the rights to the money changes hands 
        by the transfer of quantity between accounts -- shown above as <i>purses</i> 
        within the issuers. When Alice places the gold bar on the board, her computer, 
        the $-Issuer, and the contract host engage in a three-way cryptographic 
        transaction that brings about the transfer of title, at the $-Issuer, 
        of that much money from Alice to the contract host. An honest contract 
        host would consider this money to be only a piece on the board, which 
        can be picked up (transferred to the possession of a player) according 
        to whatever may be the rules of the game. We refer to this as <i>oblivious 
        escrow</i> -- the contract host, merely by running the contract, ensures 
        that erights in escrow can only be released under the agreed conditions, 
        without needing to understand those conditions or those erights.</p>
      <p>A dishonest contract host could abscond with the money instead, which 
        is why contract hosts need to be widely trusted. A widely trusted contract 
        host presumably has a valuable reputation at stake, which helps secure 
        its honest behavior. (More sophisticated cryptographic protocols are possible 
        which further limit a player's vulnerability to a dishonest contract host 
        or issuer [<a href="#Beaver98">Beaver98</a>], but these are beyond the 
        scope of this paper.) </p>
      <p> The money is an eright in part because it is <i>third-party assayable. 
        </i> Even though Bob does not currently possess this eright, Bob, through 
        the contract host, can determine which issuer backs this eright, and what 
        the value of this eright is according to this issuer. With such assayability, 
        the $-Issuer, the Stock-Issuer, and the contract host each need not have 
        any prior knowledge or trust of any of the other four players. For the 
        game to be meaningful, Alice and Bob must have prior knowledge and trust 
        in both issuers and the contract host, but not in each other. Even if 
        Alice and Bob are both use-once pseudonymous identities with no apparent 
        physical location [<a href="#Vinge84">Vinge84</a>], under these conditions, 
        they can transact with each other <i>as if</i> they fully trust each other. 
        The hubs -- the issuers and the contract host -- thereby succeed at providing 
        virtual trust connectivity between their spokes: Alice and Bob.</p>
      <h3><a name="equation"></a>Assets + Contracts x Time + ?? = Capital</h3>
      <p><font color="#000000"><img src="images/6-option.gif" width="379" height="235" align="right">The 
        smart contracts explained so far -- the vending machine and the exchange 
        game -- cannot turn assets into capital. To do so requires contracts that 
        unfold over time, like a mortgage. To explain how such unfolding creates 
        ever more abstract forms of property, we step through a simpler example 
        contract, the <i>covered call option</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Alice has an <i>option</i> when she has the right, 
        but not the obligation, to engage in some action at some agreed price 
        before some deadline. Alice has a <i>call</i> option when she has the 
        right to buy some agreed asset, let's say stock, at some agreed price 
        before the deadline. The option is a <i>covered</i> call option when Alice's 
        counterparty, Bob, escrows up front the stock Alice may decide to purchase.</font></p>
      <p>We may visualize this as the game shown in Figure 6. In the initial board 
        state A, the stock is already on the board. While in this state, neither 
        Alice nor Bob may pick up the stock. A new element in the game is the 
        game clock, attached to a transition arrow, that only permits that transition 
        after a deadline has expired. Should the deadline expire while the game 
        is still in state A, Bob could then pick up his stock and go home, leaving 
        the game in terminal state B.</p>
      <p>Or, before the deadline expires, Alice may decide to <i>exercise</i> 
        the option. She may place a gold piece on the left square. Unlike in the 
        previous game, in this game the acceptable amounts are predetermined by 
        the rules. The left square only accepts the amount of money agreed on 
        when the game was constructed. If Alice places this amount of money on 
        the board, this is the irrevocable commitment step shown as the bold unidirectional 
        arrow, taking us to state C. After this move, the only remaining legal 
        moves are for Alice to pick up the stock, and for Bob to pick up the money.</p>
      <p>What is so different about this contract? During the interval of time 
        from the start of the game until the game leaves state A (whether by expiration 
        or exercise) Alice has something valuable. During this interval, Alice 
        has the option to buy this stock for a given price. This is a very different 
        kind of value than the value of stock or money themselves. The value of 
        this new right <i>derives</i> from the value of the stock and the money, 
        but whereas they are very simple literal kinds of rights, this new right 
        is somehow more abstract. In Wall Street terminology, the new right is 
        a <i>derivative</i> of the more literal <i>underlying</i> rights. In de 
        Soto's terminology, if the literal instruments are physical <i>assets</i>, 
        then abstract rights derived by contracts about these instruments are 
        a step towards being <i>capital</i>. </p>
      <p>But there's something missing from this picture. Through the system so 
        far depicted, Alice can trade those erights managed by issuers: money 
        and stock. The contract host, despite its complete ignorance that it has 
        done so, has created a new valuable right, owned by Alice. But in the 
        picture so far, Alice has no ability to trade this new right. This needs 
        to be repaired, in order for these new rights to truly be capital, and 
        in order for yet more abstract forms of capital to be derived from them. 
        De Soto's <i>capital</i>, besides being an abstraction built from widely 
        tradable rights, is also itself widely tradable, enabling further abstraction 
        -- the creation of yet more forms of capital.</p>
      <h3><img src="images/7-layering.gif" width="308" height="304" align="right">Networks 
        of Games</h3>
      <p>To make this new right Alice holds widely tradable, we need to turn this 
        right -- the right to continue playing the left side of this ongoing game 
        -- into an eright, a third-party-assayable transferable electronic right. 
        To do so requires an issuer for this new right. Since the contract host 
        is already managing access to this chair, we may as well have it double 
        as the issuer for the eright to sit in this chair. Just as Alice could 
        tell the $-Issuer to transfer some of her money from her purse to someone 
        else's, we can enable Alice to tell the contract host to transfer her 
        eright to sit in this chair to someone else. The contract host would then 
        revoke Alice's access to the chair and issue fresh access to the other 
        player, much as the $-Issuer would with Alice's money.</p>
      <p>With this ability to compose networks of games, it seems we have the 
        ability to express the full range of contract layering used in modern 
        finance. Not that modern finance is directly relevant to the needs of 
        the poor, but it is a good test of the generality of our framework.</p>
      <p>But wait. In order to resolve our conflict, this structure decouples 
        knowledge in a way quite different than anything in the financial world. 
        We have the contract host issuing rights it does not understand, since 
        these rights are produced by games it runs, but does not understand. The 
        contract host is not in a position to vouch for any meaningful property 
        of the rights it is issuing, so how can widespread trust in the contract 
        host translate into credible global transferability of derived rights? 
        How can this derived right be assayable if even its issuer doesn't understand 
        it? Let's walk through the example depicted in Figure 7.</p>
      <p>Alice starts out simply as a player of the original options game, hosted 
        by contract host #1, whose five participants are enclosed in the horizontal 
        rectangle. While Alice finds herself in the resulting valuable situation 
        -- while the options game is in state A -- she encounters Fred, who would 
        also find this situation valuable. Fred, were he convinced that Alice's 
        chair sitting rights mean what Alice says they mean, would be willing 
        to play a different game on contract host #2, perhaps our original negotiation 
        game, in which this right, issued by contract host #1, would appear as 
        a movable piece. Alice appears in the same role in both these games -- 
        as a player. Contract host #1 also appears in both these games -- it appears 
        as the contract host in game #1, and it appears as an issuer in, game 
        #2, of the right to sit in the left chair of game #1. Hence the tilted 
        overlap of the rectangles.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, having just met, Fred and Alice don't trust each any more 
        than Alice and Bob do. Fortunately, Fred does have prior knowledge and 
        trust of contract host #1. Unfortunately, contract host #1 has no idea 
        if the right to sit in this chair of this game means what Alice claims 
        it means, or anything else. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, with Alice's consent, Fred can ask contract host #1 for 
        the text of the contract (the source code of the program), the current 
        state of the board, and the assays of all the pieces presently on the 
        board (i.e., escrowed by the game). In theory, these should be sufficient 
        for Fred to figure out what these derived rights are, so third party assayability 
        has been provided in theory, but not yet in practice.</p>
      <p>Alice, who presumably understands the game she's playing, can help Fred 
        figure this out, and Fred can accept Alice's help, without any trust required 
        between Fred and Alice. Should the contract truly be idiosyncratic to 
        local knowledge shared by Alice and Bob, knowledge to which Fred has no 
        access, he may not find the derived rights comprehensible at reasonable 
        cost and move on. More commonly, if the contract is understandable to 
        some number of others, including some Fred trusts, Fred may turn to them 
        for advice on the contract's meaning -- the analog of legal advice. With 
        this step, derived rights become erights about which other contracts can 
        be written, deriving yet further erights.</p>
      <h3><a name="resolution"></a>Resolving the Conflict</h3>
      <p>The above steps, applied to informally owned assets, could resolve the 
        conflict de Soto explains, providing global transferability without resort 
        to procrustean homogenization of legal systems. </p>
      <p>The first step, the separation of the contract from the contract host, 
        allows the contract to specialize in capturing local knowledge, while 
        the contract host specializes in providing the trust connectivity needed 
        for global transferability. Our new technological enablers -- the ability 
        of the contract host to safely and faithfully run rights-handling code 
        it neither trusts nor understands -- allows these two specialties to be 
        combined without conflict. </p>
      <p>Our second step is contracts that unfold over time, creating derived 
        rights. This step would be applied twice. First, to model the base rights 
        <i>as if</i> they were derived from prior simpler rights to more literal 
        physical objects. Informally owned assets are not literal physical objects 
        themselves, they are rights derived from these objects according to informal 
        local laws and negotiated arrangements. To the extent the logic of these 
        arrangements can be successfully expressed in the new language of smart 
        contracts -- with more literal physical objects represented as underlying 
        assets, <i>as if</i> these had once been separately owned -- then the 
        smart contract will have preserved this local knowledge in a form that 
        can be uploaded to widely trusted contract hosts. </p>
      <p>The third step turns the local-knowledge embodying rights created in 
        the previous steps into widely tradable erights. This step allows these 
        three steps to be applied repeatedly, creating complex networks of contracts 
        that build on each other. This allows the second step to be applied yet 
        again to create yet more abstract erights, like mortgage, setting loose 
        the power of capital formation. The collateral would be, not the physical 
        property itself, but the rights to the property held by the original property 
        holder, according to customary law in that community, as recorded at the 
        time of titling.</p>
      <p>Although the conflict is resolved in this scenario, there will remain 
        pressures for homogenizing capital-creating contracts; but these are normal 
        market pressures. In the above scenario, Alice will no longer lose the 
        sale to Fred through Fred's lack of trust in Alice. But she is still in 
        danger of losing the sale through Fred's difficulty understanding the 
        contract's meaning. Further, only standardized contracts can create fungible 
        assets tradable on large exchanges. Fortunately, these pressures can gradually 
        work themselves out over time, and in competition with the benefits provided 
        by custom contracts, well after starting on the digital path. By contrast, 
        on the governmental path pervasive rule homogenization is the necessary 
        first step, and therefore also a major barrier to starting on that path.</p>
      <h1><a name="legitimacy"></a>Backing and Legitimacy</h1>
      <p>For purely electronic assets, like fiat money and stock, at this point 
        we have, perhaps, an adequate picture. The title listing for these assets 
        is the reality of ownership -- there is no separate issue of physical 
        control that may or may not follow along. To explain how smart contracts 
        may be applied to Wall Street, we could perhaps stop here. But we have 
        not yet succeeded at the mission we set out on -- to establish credibility 
        of title transfer at a distance, in order to unlock the potential capital 
        in the poor's $9.3 trillion dollars of extralegal buildings, land, etc.</p>
      <p>Actual control of such physical assets is determined, not by their title 
        listing, but by consensus of the governing community in question. Why 
        wouldn't the digital path fail in the same way the pre-de Soto governmental 
        attempts failed? Why would these communities consider these title transfers 
        legitimate and honor them?</p>
      <p>The governmental path has an advantage here. Governments employ a vast 
        coercive apparatus to enforce the outcomes they claim are legitimate, 
        such as eviction following a title transfer. Still, even with this advantage, 
        the previous attempts failed when title listings not locally seen as legitimate 
        were not honored. Under these circumstances, even governments mostly understood 
        that coercive enforcement would have had too terrible a cost. De Soto 
        documents well the repeated victories of squatters over governmental law.</p>
      <p>The missing ingredient was the need to accommodate preexisting local 
        arrangements. These are the source of the legitimacy governing current 
        control of the property, and any new system can only be seen as legitimate 
        if it incorporates and builds on the old. On this issue, the digital path 
        has the huge advantage over the governmental one explained above. But 
        what of the disadvantage? The Net is a purely non-coercive medium, it 
        transmits only information -- effectively speech -- but cannot transmit 
        force. Smart contracts can change their electronic records which claim 
        to be about the world -- such as title -- but they cannot force the world 
        to follow along [<a href="#Friedman00">Friedman00</a>]. Unlike government-based 
        title transfer, these changes of title are not <i>backed</i> by a coercive 
        enforcement apparatus. How may we compensate for this lack? For concreteness, 
        in order to establish possibility, we propose here two complementary techniques, 
        but we do not presume to foresee what the actual outcome of the market 
        discovery process will be. This should be an area ripe for entrepreneurial 
        invention.</p>
      <h3><a name="ratings"></a>Ratings</h3>
      <p>The issue of credibility does not require <i>all</i> title listings to 
        have high credibility. Rather, it is adequate for distant traders, who 
        have no knowledge of a particular governing village, to nevertheless have 
        some reliable basis for judging the credibility of <i>particular</i> title 
        listings. An obvious answer is to introduce another trusted intermediary 
        institution into this market -- title insurance. Once the digital path 
        matures, this solution may be ideal, but as a way to get started it has 
        a fatal problem -- it requires a crippling up front capital investment, 
        in order to cover the massive potential liabilities. Rather, another familiar 
        form of intermediary may be adapted to this situation.</p>
      <p>Bond rating agencies provide the market with an estimate of the likelihood 
        that a business or government will actually meet the obligations represented 
        by its outstanding bonds. The rating agency does not attempt to estimate 
        what the price of the bond should be -- that is left to the market, which 
        takes these likelihoods into account. A bond rating agency does not put 
        its money where its mouth is -- it does not issue bond insurance to back 
        its likelihood estimates. Rather, it backs its estimates with its reputation, 
        which can become quite valuable, but is still cheaper than issuing insurance.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in our situation, we can imagine a market of third party raters 
        that post judgments of the likelihood that transfer of a given title will 
        actually be honored [<a href="#Stanley01">Stanley01</a>]. Simply recording 
        each village's track record of honoring past title transfers, and assuming 
        the future will be like the recent past, is a low overhead procedure that's 
        plausibly adequate. And it places each village in an iterated game with 
        the system as a whole, providing it an incentive to treat these titles 
        as legitimate claims, subjecting them to the local tradition's means of 
        enforcement. We can think of this as a credit report, not for an individual, 
        but for a village and its system of local law.</p>
      <h3><a name="video"></a>Video Contracts</h3>
      <p>But legitimacy is more than just preserving local arrangements, and it 
        is more than just incentives or force. It is knowing in your bones what 
        the right thing is, based on the kinds of evidence you are used to taking 
        into account. One day a distant voice on the phone tells Bob to vacate 
        his family home because, it claims, his late father Sam took out a loan 
        from a distant bank Bob has never heard of. Bob believes that if this 
        were true, Bob would have heard about it from Sam. The evidence presented 
        by these disembodied strangers are impersonal electronic records Bob can 
        hardly understand, much less verify. Perhaps Bob is told the veracity 
        of these records can be verified by cryptographic means. Why should Bob 
        believe them? Absent coercive power to evict, why should Bob even take 
        them seriously? Why not just stay in his home?</p>
      <p>Bob's community does have power of various sort over him, probably including 
        the power to evict, if there is sufficient local consensus in the legitimacy 
        of the claims of the outsider. However, Bob is a known member of the community. 
        Why would they take an outsider's word over his? The incentives produced 
        by rating agencies is far too weak an answer.</p>
      <p>Into this situation, let's introduce Szabo's <i>Video Contract</i> [<a href="#Szabo98">Szabo98</a>]. 
        As Szabo explains, a contract is supposed to represent a meeting of the 
        minds, but complex lawyer-written contracts on paper no longer plausibly 
        meet this standard. Verbal contracts often do at the moment of the handshake 
        -- both parties have just had a rich conversational interaction, full 
        of all the conscious and subconscious cues we use to understand what each 
        other understands -- so they plausibly have a good sense of what they 
        jointly mean to agree to. However, memory is fleeting, so people turned 
        instead to paper to record agreements, trading away richness, sincerity, 
        and vividness in order to get permanence. At the time it was a necessary 
        trade.</p>
      <p>But no longer. Using video cameras, also rapidly dropping in price, contracting 
        parties could now record their conversation about the contract's meaning, 
        and store it with the contract for future reference. Ideally, a title 
        listing could store the entire chain of videos for the chain of contracts 
        by which the property changed hands -- starting with the initial video 
        interview at the time the initial title record was created. The outsider 
        could show, to both Bob and his community, the video of the conversation 
        with Sam about the meaning of the contract. For most communities, given 
        general confidence the video isn't fake, seeing Sam explain clearly what 
        rights he's trading away will be enough to establish legitimacy. After 
        all, that's Sam talking, not some outsider making dry claims about Sam's 
        past intentions. Such recordings should also help overcome barriers of 
        language and literacy.</p>
      <p>Open areas to explore include technological means to inhibit forgery 
        (like time-stamping digital notaries), and how one presents the results 
        of such integrity checks as evidence properly credible to non-computer 
        people.</p>
      <h1><a name="limits"></a>Limitations and Hazards</h1>
      <p>The governmental path, having been previously navigated, has limitation, 
        problems, and dangers we can anticipate. The digital path is untrod and 
        mostly unknown, and subject to the blind spots of wishful thinking. In 
        this section we take a first stab at some of the problems lurking ahead 
        of us, but many more issues remain.</p>
      <h3><a name="human"></a>Incorporating Human Language, Perception, and Judgment</h3>
      <p>Many preexisting and desired arrangements will not be expressible purely 
        as smart contracts. Conventional contracts make use of the rich expressiveness 
        of human language, perception, and judgment; all of which are vastly more 
        subtle and sophisticated than any currently automatable alternative. Between 
        the poles of fully human contracts and fully automated contracts is a 
        spectrum of arrangements we call <i>split contracts</i> -- the contract 
        is split between automated and non-automated parts. The first smart contracting 
        system, AMIX [<a href="#Walker89">Walker89</a>, <a href="#Miller99">Miller99</a>], 
        demonstrates some of the ways to design split contracts so the two parts 
        can play together well, enabling us to take advantage of the strengths 
        of both.</p>
      <p>For example, a split contract could consist of </p>
      <ul>
        <li>an automated game, adequate if a dispute does not arise; </li>
        <li>natural language text expressing what the game could not, relevant 
          only during a dispute; and</li>
        <li> an agreement on which person or institution should read the text 
          and arbitrate the outcome of a dispute. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>From a game-centric perspective, the ability to declare the outcome to 
        be in dispute is only another move in the game, and the arbiter is only 
        another player. From a paper-contract-centric perspective, the text as 
        interpreted by the arbiter is the outcome of last resort, and so is the 
        &quot;real&quot; contract -- the game is only a lighter weight approximation 
        for typical non-disputed cases.</p>
      <p>Another form of split would be by layers. Whereas the logic of a mortgage 
        game may be fully automated, the rights being put up as collateral are 
        limited to those held by the original property holder according to the 
        governing village's law. The contract needed to represent these latter 
        may often remain mostly non-automated. In Figure 7, contract host #1, 
        as issuer of these locally-defined rights, would provide Fred as well 
        with the text or video, and the identity of the agreed arbiter. Fred would 
        then take these into account in assessing the value of Alice's chair -- 
        the rights Alice would like to use as collateral.</p>
      <h3><a name="capture"></a>Regulatory Capture <i>vs.</i> Regulatory Arbitrage</h3>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <p>Historically, the growth of widely trusted large scale institutions in 
        the West -- and the corresponding partial concentration of economic activity 
        into the trust backbone -- made possible the rise of the large regulatory 
        state. This concentration, despite its benefits, also dramatically lowered 
        the cost of regulation, as there were far fewer places in the economy 
        that needed monitoring, such as the banks. These concentrations made economic 
        activities of various sorts subject to <i>regulatory capture</i>.</p>
      <p>Although the Net has allowed the consumers of electronic goods and services 
        to escape limitations of geography and jurisdiction, so far it has not 
        provided the same escape for producers, especially those with worldwide 
        name recognition. These remain tied to some government, and subject to 
        its decrees. </p>
      <p>On de Soto's governmental path, the informals come to be dependent on 
        the integrity of their own governments, in danger of local regulatory 
        capture. On the digital path, by having their contracts rely on the trustworthiness 
        of first world trust hubs, haven't we just transferred this vulnerability 
        from their own governments to those of the first world, over which they 
        have even less influence? </p>
      <div align="center"> 
        <table cellpadding="12" width="80%">
          <tr> 
            <td> <p align="right"><i>The Net treats censorship as damage and routes

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The nature of the dangers depends on the nature of the architecture [<a href="#Lessig99">Lessig99</a>]. 
        The architectures of the first generation of electronic media -- radio 
        and television -- amplified censorship and diminished free speech [<a href="#Pool84">Pool84</a>]. 
        The architecture of the Net has dramatically turned this around, creating 
        actual freedom of speech more absolutely than even the best constitutions. 
        Might a decent architecture for distributed smart contracting treat regulation 
        as damage and route around it? </p>
      <p>The most powerful answer is already implicit in the architecture of the 
        digital path -- a diversity of contract hosts, spread across competing 
        jurisdictions, themselves competing to establish a reputation for operating 
        honestly. Any one government going bad would endanger many contracts and 
        much property, but will cause a flight of electronic business towards 
        climates expected to remain freer. </p>
      <p>The field of <i>fault tolerant computing</i> studies how to build reliable 
        systems from unreliable components. For example, for certain demanding 
        applications an individual actual computer may be considered unreliable, 
        but a reliable virtual computer may be synthesized from several actual 
        computers by comparing the outcome of each step in a kind of voting process. 
        Due to dangers of regulatory capture as well as internal corruption, an 
        actual first-world trust hub may be considered an analogously unreliable 
        component. From a set of these we may synthesize a reliable virtual trust 
        hub in a variety of ways, such as a <i>voting protocol</i> in which a 
        <i>quorum</i> of, let's say, 5 out of 7 actual contract hosts have to 
        agree on an outcome in order for it to be considered an outcome of the 
        synthetic virtual contract host; and in order for that game's issuers 
        to honor the outcome. These issuers themselves can be virtual reliable 
        issuers in this same sense [<a href="#Szabo99">Szabo99</a>]. </p>
      <p>Making such technologies work is tricky, so we should not try to achieve 
        trans-jurisdictional fault tolerance before we get started, but we should 
        also make sure not to paint ourselves into a corner -- we need to understand 
        how a simpler working system could incrementally grow to support such 
        fault tolerant protocols.</p>
      <h3></h3>
      <h1><a name="thirdfirst"></a>Why the Third World First?</h1>
      <p>This new world of Net-based jurisdiction-free coercionless smart contracting 
        -- the digital path -- is an option for the first world as well as the 
        third. Both groups stand to gain tremendously by this transition. Virtually 
        all progress to date towards the digital path [<a href="#Johnson96">Johnson96</a>, 
        <a href="#Lessig99">Lessig99</a>, <a href="#Krecke01">Krecke01</a>] has 
        been in the first world. Nevertheless, once technology costs become inconsequential, 
        we expect the third world to overtake and then lead the first in making 
        this transition. Why?</p>
      <h3><a name="legitimacy"></a>Comparative Legitimacy</h3>
      <p>Primarily because, once again, of the issue of legitimacy. The character 
        of legitimacy in the first world is quite different than the legitimacy 
        we have been discussing among the third world's informals. First world 
        societies, having made the transition to the governmental path long ago, 
        have enjoyed great wealth, but have paid a subtle price in flexibility. 
        In most rich first world countries the issue of legitimacy is inextricably 
        coupled to legality. For a business in these countries to be judged legitimate 
        by the culture, and for others to consider their dealings with this business 
        to be legitimate, the business must be legal -- it must operate within 
        the formal legal system. By contrast, among the informals the formal legal 
        system has no monopoly on legitimacy -- many extralegal institutions enjoy 
        widespread popular legitimacy.</p>
      <p>As explained above, a new system of law will only be seen as legitimate 
        if it accommodates, incorporates, and builds on preexisting systems of 
        legitimacy. The preexisting formal and informal systems each have a very 
        different kind of great complexity; and the effort to accommodate this 
        complexity, to express these rules in the language of smart contracts, 
        can seriously impede these transitions. </p>
      <p>Among the informals the great complexity comes from the sheer number 
        of local arrangements that need to be expressed. The people's law of each 
        individual village, being largely unwritten, may be simpler than formal 
        law. More important, the very informality of these systems allows them 
        to compromise. As long as an adequate spirit of the law is uploaded, imperfect 
        expressions can often be judged to be <i>good enough</i>. This lets the 
        transition get started incrementally, village by village, and imperfectly.</p>
      <p>By contrast, although there are far fewer separate systems of formal 
        law, each is a vast growth of complexity that no one even pretends to 
        understand. However, because of the formality with which this law is administered, 
        and the absence of competitive pressures, this system brooks no compromise 
        except through politically-driven change. This is a high enough bar that 
        a smart contract system, to be legitimate by this standard, might emerge 
        so slowly as to be a non-issue.</p>
      <h3><a name="homogenization"></a>Homogenization Costs</h3>
      <p>The costs of rule homogenization discussed above, to be paid on the governmental 
        path, is a cost that has already been paid and largely forgotten in the 
        first world. The first world has already lost this great source of diversity, 
        so the digital path's option to avoid paying these costs is not a selling 
        point there.</p>
      <h3><a name="cellphones"></a>Cell Phones in Eastern Europe</h3>
      <p>Cell phones first became society-wide hits in poor countries with terrible 
        telecommunication, not in rich high-tech societies. (My own observations 
        of Prague <i>vs.</i> Silicon Valley in 1998 corroborate this -- cell phones 
        were everywhere in Prague.) Not having a working phone network, cell phones 
        offered a huge advantage over their prior situation. They offered a much 
        more minor improvement in societies where the land lines work. Those without 
        an adequate prior system were able to more quickly leapfrog over to a 
        better system. There is no necessary sequence of telecommunication systems 
        that each society must separately recapitulate.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the informals have no access to working global networks of 
        trust and commerce. The digital path offers them tremendous new opportunities. 
        In the West, it provides a smaller improvement, and an improvement over 
        a system many consider imperfect but adequate.</p>
      <h3><a name="firstsecond"></a>Saving the First World</h3>
      <p>Should the third world be the first to succeed at the digital path, and 
        should this in fact unleash their potential capital, causing markets to 
        bloom, creating vast wealth, how would this effect the first world?</p>
      <p>Formal laws in the first world do change under political pressure. One 
        of the more effective sources of pressure are those who stand to gain 
        from large scale commerce with the rest of the world. Once a significant 
        part of the world's economy is occurring in the digital path, first world 
        businesses would then face a choice -- trade with these networks or stay 
        legal-legitimate. This is an unpleasant choice both for them and their 
        governments. The pressures will be great to legalize trade with these 
        jurisdiction-free networks of commerce. Once such unregulatable trade 
        is made legal, the dam will have burst. What will be the character of 
        the resulting world?</p>
      <h1> <a name="rulelaw"></a>The Rule of Law and Not of Men</h1>
      <p>Surprisingly perhaps, the character of the digital path may best be described 
        as a pure form of the classical liberal ideal -- <i>the rule of law and 
        not of men</i>. Indeed, the digital path could more literally realize 
        the meaning of those words than anything the original classical liberals 
        could possibly have conceived. </p>
      <p>This is not just a cheap play on words. The ideal they were describing 
        was of a neutral simple framework of rules, enforced <i>impartially</i> 
        and <i>justly</i>, providing for cooperation without vulnerability -- 
        protecting individuals from each other while enabling them to cooperate 
        with each other. A key means of enabling cooperation was the original 
        right of contract, where almost any mutually acceptable arrangement could 
        be made binding, with the law serving as the mutually trusted intermediary 
        for securing the arrangement. With smart contracts, the encoded rules 
        themselves become the logic of their own enforcement, subject only to 
        the honesty, not the judgment or skill, of a diverse market of competing 
        contract hosts. This competition forms a vastly stronger and fully decentralized 
        system of checks and balances. </p>
      <p>The third world could rise on an enhanced version of the principles on 
        which the West grew rich.</p>
