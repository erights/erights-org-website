      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">*** To be written</font></p>
      <h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
      <p>As Hernando de Soto explains in &quot;The Mystery of Capital&quot; [<a href="#deSoto00">deSoto00</a>], 
        the poor of the third world (including much of the former communist world) 
        do not suffer from, in his terminology, a lack of <i>assets</i>; rather, 
        they suffer from a lack of <i>capital</i>. Many of the poor around the 
        world do, surprisingly enough, have assets. In a simple exercise, in which 
        de Soto's associates drove around neighborhoods in various poor countries, 
        assessing the value of buildings which were not formally titled, de Soto 
        extrapolated that the value of just the informally owned buildings in 
        the third world amounted to $9.3 trillion -- more than half the combined 
        value of all publicly traded U.S. companies.</p>
      <p>De Soto's focus is on the <i>informal</i> sector -- that sphere of economic 
        activity that occurs outside the official <i>formal</i> legal system. 
        Most of the economic activity of the third world's poor occurs in the 
        informal sector. Despite the non-official status of the informal systems 
        of laws and property in this sector, they are nevertheless quite real, 
        and form the foundations on which these informal economies function. However, 
        the formal and informal sectors are not otherwise equivalent. The poor 
        pay a great price for informality -- most of all in the difficulty of 
        capital formation.</p>
      <p>As a simple example, the house you live in, from which no one would attempt 
        to evict you, is an asset. The recognition and sense of legitimacy in 
        your local community of your claim to the house makes this asset effectively 
        your property. A mortgage on that house would be capital. (In the countries 
        that have become rich, mortgages in particular have been a major source 
        of highly decentralized investment, seeding many family businesses.) But 
        just because no one can evict you from your house, this does not mean 
        a bank dares accept it as collateral for a loan. The distinction is one 
        of <i>credibility of property rights transfer at a distance</i>, i.e., 
        the ability to engage in binding contracts such that the new owners could 
        be confident they could indeed evict you as part of the contract, despite 
        their distance from your community.</p>
      <p>De Soto's offer of hope for the poor is to transition into today's official 
        formal system of law and property, backed by national governments, in 
        order to obtain the benefits of capital formation. De Soto documents well 
        both the high comparative costs of operating formally, and the difficulties 
        of bringing about the transition, but successfully makes the case that 
        the benefits outweigh the costs. Today, there are only these two choices 
        -- informal <i>vs.</i> governmental. Given only these choices, we believe 
        de Soto is advocating the right one, we wish him great luck with his program, 
        and we do not wish to distract those who are able to make this transition 
        successfully. Indeed, we can imagine few more effective programs for improving 
        the overall condition of humanity.</p>
      <p>Despite our admiration, this paper takes a different approach; it explores 
        a third alternative, one openned up by new technologies. Because binding 
        contracts for ownership transfer lie at the heart of capital formation, 
        if traditional contracts were supplemented and/or supplanted with <i>smart 
        contracts</i>, which leverage the Net and cryptography for mediating disputes 
        and enabling cooperation among suspicious parties, could such instruments(**?) 
        dramatically increase capital liquidity, spawning a flood of new wealth 
        in the poorest areas of the world? (Given the exponential rate at which 
        the cost of electronics is falling, the cost of the tecnology itself should 
        rapidly become a non-issue, even for the world's poorest.)</p>
      <h3><a name="personal-bricks"></a><img src="images/1-engelbart.gif" width="365" height="168" align="right">Removing 
        the Next Brick</h3>
      <p>The new technologies of the Net and cryptography present tremendous opportunities 
        for improving the nature of society. But improving society is a difficult 
        task. More generally, improving complex systems is a difficult task. If 
        you cannot figure out which way is up, see if you can figure out which 
        way is down. Doug Engelbart, back in the early 1960s [<a href="#Engelbart62">Engelbart62</a>], 
        wanted to explain to people why interactive systems would make a significant 
        difference to their lives, and augment their ability to express ideas. 
      </p>
      <p>In Figure 1, the origin on the axis is what people were doing at the 
        time--writing with pencil and paper. When he found himself unable to communicate 
        how much better things could be, he contrasted their current experiences 
        with how much <i>worse </i>things could be. He tied a pencil to a brick, 
        handed it to people and said, &quot;Okay, now write.&quot; People found 
        it very difficult. The unwieldy nature of the tool interfered with their 
        ability to express ideas. With the pencil and brick for contrast, he effectively 
        asked two questions: &quot;What made the difference?&quot; and, &quot;How 
        can we move further in the other direction?&quot; This experiment showed 
        people how important their tools and their media were to their effectiveness, 
        and helped them start to see the next brick to remove. This thought experiment 
        led directly to seminal work responsible for much of the modern world 
        of interactive systems that we now take for granted.</p>
      <div align="center"> 
        <table cellpadding="12">
          <tr> 
            <td> <p align="center"><i>It is easy to turn an aquarium into fish 
                soup,<br>

      <p>The 20th century performed a similar experiment on a grand scale, tying 
        large bricks to large societies with the best of intentions, but with 
        vastly tragic consequences. Only by learning from this experiment may 
        our good intentions yield better results, and this vast human tragedy 
        will at least not have been in vain. Once we can see the bricks that were 
        tied to these societies, and understand how they precipitated these tragic 
        outcomes, we may see clearly the bricks that remain, and start to imagine 
        their removal as well. Not just to bring the rest of the world up to the 
        standard enjoyed by the first world, but to move past this point as well. 
      <h3><a name="openness"></a>The Brick of Constrained Speech</h3>
      <p><img src="images/2-soviet.gif" width="381" height="145" align="right">The 
        most obvious contrast between these two societies is summed up by their 
        common labels: <i>closed societies</i> and <i>open societies</i>. Knowledge 
        evolves well only through a process of open discourse and criticism, in 
        which no <i>official truth</i> is held beyond skeptical re-examination 
        [<a href="#Bartley62">Bartley62</a>]. Economic activities spontaneously 
        organize through a process of decentralized plan coordination. Open discourse 
        is a crucial part (together with prices) of the means by which economic 
        agents coordinate their plans with each other [<a href="#Lavoie01">Lavoie01</a>]. 
        Constraints on speech in the closed societies placed a burden not only 
        on the individuals in those societies -- this brick made those societies 
        as a whole stupider. When authority can be used to prevent open questioning 
        or negotiation, simple disbelief of officials truths is all that remains.</p>
      <p>The brick of constrained speech is in the process of being removed yet 
        again as we speak. The right of free speech, which underpins so much of 
        the strength of western civilization, is being transformed by the Net. 
        In today's Net-enhanced society, freedom of speech is no longer a right 
        which needs to be negotiated between citizen and state; rather, it is 
        a technological fact that accepts no compromise. This new Net-empowered 
        right to free speech is effectively a law, but is a completely <i>jurisdiction 
        free law</i>--even if all the nations of the world agreed that speech 
        should be constrained, no constraint would prevail, as none would be enforceable.</p>
      <h3><a name="tech-law"></a>Technological, Jurisdiction-Free Law</h3>
      <p>The advent of technologically-based, jurisdiction-free law has many ramifications 
        [<a href="#Lessig99">Lessig99</a>]. Even in the US, where free speech 
        has historically been not merely respected but worshipped, free speech 
        was by common consent still somewhat constrained. The obvious example 
        was the duty not to shout &quot;Fire!&quot; in a movie theater, but the 
        enduring example has been copyright law. Historically America had a good 
        balance between copyright and free speech. But a technological fact has 
        no ability to compromise: there is no one to negotiate a compromise with. 
        So copyright becomes unenforceable even though it has the universal support 
        of all the world's major jurisdictions [<a href="#Kelsey99">Kelsey99</a>].</p>
      <p>Technological facts would seem to be morally neutral. Should we expect 
        technological laws in general to be either good or bad? Taken by itself, 
        the loss of copyright is probably an example of a bad consequence. Copyright 
        addresses a genuine externality problem in the creation of new knowledge. 
        Although copyright addresses the problem imperfectly, all the alternatives 
        that remain enforceable seem much worse. The world will probably be poorer 
        for the loss of copyright. (Though it's worth noting that the Net seems 
        to be vastly accelerating the creation and disemmination of knowledge, 
        even as it destroys the conventional incentives for engaging in these 
        activities.)</p>
      <p>Despite this negative example, we can expect the new technological laws 
        produced by the Net to be, on the whole, beneficial. Interaction through 
        the Net is inherently coercionless: no one can point a gun at you through 
        your monitor screen. You could <i>send</i> someone a virus, and under 
        today's law that would be considered a use of force. After all, the virus 
        does cause harm to the recipient. But sending viruses is also a form of 
        speech, and under the technological law of the Net, ultimately cannot 
        be constrained. The logic of John Stuart Mill's defense of free speech 
        [<a href="#Mill69">Mill69</a>] applies perfectly to this situation.</p>
      <p>John Stuart Mill never claimed that &quot;bad&quot; speech could not 
        harm the listener. Rather, he observed a crucial difference between the 
        harm done by speech and the harm done by force. Speech does harm only 
        by virtue of the reaction of the listener. If the listener learns to react 
        differently to a certain pattern of speech, that pattern is rendered harmless. 
        After all, it's only information; it cannot by itself cause damage. The 
        only effective answer to bad speech is more speech, as only this enables 
        the listener to grow from gullibility or cynicism into skepticism.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the Net only transmits information -- including viruses. A 
        virus can only do harm based on the reaction -- the means of processing 
        and operation -- of the computer receiving the virus [<a href="#Hardy99">Hardy99</a>]. 
        The good news is that the damage done by computer viruses (or any malicious 
        bit pattern) is not mandated by technological law, since computer security 
        is possible. The disemmination of viruses cannot be prevented, so the 
        only effective response to their bad bits are other bits -- the software 
        of virus-invulnerable secure operating systems [<a href="#Hardy85">Hardy85</a>, 
        <a href="#Shapiro99">Shapiro99</a>], programming languages [<a href="#Hewitt73">Hewitt73</a>, 
        <a href="#Tribble95">Tribble95</a>, <a href="#Rees96">Rees96</a>, <a href="#Miller00">Miller00</a>], 
        and user interfaces [<a href="#Walker">Walker</a>]. Only such software 
        enables our computers to grow from fatal gullibility or safe-but-useless 
        seclusion into rich <i>cooperation-without-vulnerability</i> with the 
        rest of the electronic world. This growth in turn will enable the removal 
        of the next brick.</p>
      <p>(In contrast to a common misunderstanding, the cited works demonstrate 
        that secure computer systems need not be less capable or harder to use 
        than insecure systems. Indeed, it seems the only significant comparative 
        cost paid for security is incompatibility with the installed base. Although 
        this cost is not to be underestimated, the current situation -- in which 
        13 years olds easily compromise hundreds of fatally gullible computers 
        used by others -- may not be stable, once knowledge of an alternative 
        becomes widespread.)</p>
      <h3><a name="nohubs"></a>The Brick of Missing Hubs</h3>
      <p>So many bricks have been removed, how can third world poverty remain 
        as persistently intractable as ever? Free speech was not enough. The end 
        of socialism was not enough. The universal desire for capitalism has proven 
        to be not enough. The naive view held by many people, including this author 
        when the Berlin Wall fell, was that, once government was out of the way, 
        the market would bloom and take care of the people. This has proven tragically 
        wrong. What else is missing, what other bricks must be removed?</p>
      <p>Another important brick is the one that distinguishes low-trust from 
        high-trust societies [<a href="#Fukuyama95">Fukuyama95</a>]. Complex cooperative 
        arrangements require trust. The kinds of trust relationships that are 
        possible directly impact what types of business arrangements are possible. 
        Fukuyama makes many highly perceptive observations about different <i>cultural</i> 
        attitudes and proclivities towards trust, and shows how these differences 
        seem to explain some of the observed differences in the patterns of businesses 
        that arise in these cultures.</p>
      <p>But to understand how first world societies can successfully function 
        requires something missing from Fukuyama's analysis. After all, in the 
        first world massive numbers of strangers meet, trade, do business, negotiate 
        and sign contracts, despite lack of any prior knowledge of, or reasons 
        to trust in, each other. How is this possible?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>De Soto's earlier book, <i>The Other Path</i> [<a href="#deSoto89">deSoto89</a>], 
        tells a complementary story. De Soto can also be understood as explaining 
        differences in economic organization according to differences in the possibilities 
        for trust. However, de Soto's emphasis is not culture but institutions, 
        and their lack. De Soto's portrayal of the poor within a the third world 
        village is not one of culturally-based low trust. Rather, it is the painful 
        lack of the various widely trusted intermediate institutions (or WTIIs) 
        that catalyze commerce at a distance in the first world, and that we normally 
        take for granted.</p>
      <p><b><img src="images/3-hubs.gif" width="347" height="212" align="right"></b>Trust 
        relationships can be thought of as analogous to the airport hub and spoke 
        pattern. (Figure 3). Many small local networks are interconnected on a 
        wider scale through major hubs. Although this pattern is a partial centralization, 
        it is not a hierarchy -- there is, for example, no central hub of hubs. 
        Logically, it is peer to peer, but it is built with a backbone architecture 
        due to the economics of the system. The Net itself has mostly the same 
        architecture, as does the highway system. In all cases, a sparsely connected 
        actual network acts for most purposes like a densely connected network. 
        For example, from any airport you can fly to any other airport, almost 
        as if there were flights between every pair of airports.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in the first world, two strangers can meet and conduct business 
        as if they had prior knowledge of and trust in each other, by virtue of 
        their reliance on a mutually recognizing backbone of WTIIs. These WTIIs 
        are both in the business of securing these relationships to minimize the 
        risks their customers face from each other, sometimes requiring it to 
        absorb some of these risk onto itself. The economies of scale available 
        to a WTII can help tremendously with these risks. Historically, western 
        societies have developed specialized WTIIs that bundle trust with other 
        expertise: one trusts Citibank not only because Citibank has a demonstrated 
        history of reliably backing their loans, but also because they are experts 
        in loan and risk management, which are necessary elements of reliability 
        in that field: an organization that attempted to engage in banking without 
        expertise in these fields could not be trustworthy no matter how honorable 
        the employees and executives of the organization might be.</p>
      <p>Other examples of familiar WTIIs include title companies, insurance, 
        escrow, exchanges and auction houses, underwriters, Consumer Reports, 
        Roger Ebert, notaries, arbiters, courts and cops, money, etc... The list 
        is endless. </p>
      <p>From a simple graph-theoretic point of view [<a href="#Granovetter73">Granovetter73</a>], 
        we can analyze the Fukiyama low-trust world (in which the fanout from 
        each node is small) and the de Soto missing-WTII world (in which the hubs 
        are absent), and immediately recognize which brick has the greater impact 
        on a society's effectiveness: it is the absence of the WTIIs that ultimately 
        prevent society-wide trust relationships from forming. No matter what 
        the culture, cognitive limitations prevent each of us from even knowing 
        about, much less trusting, more than a tiny fraction of the members of 
        our society. Even with high cultural proclivity for individual-to-individual 
        trust, in the absence of hubs, the resulting virtual network would at 
        best form small islands of densely connected networks, only loosely connected 
        to each other. The resulting picture resembles both Fukuyama's portrayal 
        of familial trust societies, and de Soto's portrayal of networks of villages 
        of informals.</p>

      <p>The virtual network of Figure 3 forms one large market with great extent, 
        enabling a great division of knowledge and labor. The virtual network 
        of Figure 4 is one of many separate markets, barely connected to each 
        other, and each individually of minor extent.</p>
      <p><img src="images/4-low-trust.gif" width="350" height="218" align="right">But 
        shouldn't this situation be an ideal growth medium for WTIIs? If there 
        is great market need for them, then surely there is great demand and great 
        opportunity. Indeed, this is the situation from which the WTII backbone 
        grew spontaneously in the west. Absent government oppression we should 
        indeed expect it to grow here as well. However, Western-style WTII infrastructures 
        are the result of slow growth processes; they build slowly over time. 
        These widespread trust needed by these institutions can be seen as a form 
        of capital that takes a long time to accumulate. </p>
      <p>One of the depressing features of the pictures painted by both Fukiyama 
        and de Soto is that the only hope they see for these societies is home-grown, 
        with each individual third world nation bootstrapping itself through all 
        these steps, including the evolution of their own WTIIs; or the reform 
        and transformation of each society's national government into a system 
        of widely trusted institutions. Well, it took a long time for the west. 
        If they must recapitulate our path, it will take them a long time as well, 
        a time during which desperate poverty will remorselessly prevail. What 
        enablers are available now that were unavailable when the west made this 
        transition? Might these enablers be used to help accelerate today's poor 
        through this part of the process of capital formation?</p>
      <h3><a name="title"></a>The Special Role of Title</h3>
      <p>In <i>The Other Path</i>, de Soto explained the informal economy and 
        its lack of institutions in general. Eleven years later, after much investigation 
        both of the phenomenon of persistent poverty, and an extraordinary uncovering 
        of the history of how the west overcame these problems, in <i>The Mystery 
        of Capital</i> de Soto has narrowed his focus to the crucial role played 
        by the institution of title.</p>
      <p>While all these WTIIs are valuable for the fomation of wealth creating 
        societies, not all are equally crucial. De Soto's analysis suggests that 
        the institution most needed to get the ball rolling, and which are most 
        painfully absent in the informal sectors of the third world, are credible 
        systems of title transfer. It is through widely trusted title agencies 
        that banks can become confident that the collateral against which they 
        make a loan will indeed become theirs in the event of default. This requires 
        not just trust in the title company itself, but credibility that a transfer 
        of title on the books will be honored as a transfer of ownership in reality. 
        Title registries with this level of credibility enable <i>rights transfer 
        at a distance</i>: people who have never met one another and probably 
        never will can engage in asset transfers and capital formation with the 
        confidence that they will acquire the goods specified in the contract.</p>
      <p>Although de Soto documents the independent creation of title companies 
        in the informal sector, these do not currently seem to be able to provide 
        the credibility at a distance needed for this transition.</p>
      <h3><a name="govt"></a>The Governmental Paths</h3>
      <p>Among currently existing choices, perhaps the only organization that 
        can fill this crucial titling role in a nation is the government itself. 
        This is the strategy de Soto has adopted, converting extra-legal assets, 
        village by village, into officially acknowledged parts of the formal economy. 
        The strategy has been wildly successful in bringing the poor into the 
        modern world. Working with the government of Peru, over four years, de 
        Soto's organization has formalized ??? worth of assets for a quarter of 
        a million people, creating ??? amount of capital and $2.1 billion of new 
        tax revenues for the government of Peru. One may hope and expect that 
        these demonstrated tax revenues, if nothing else, will tempt other governments 
        to follow suit.</p>
      <p>De Soto's isn't the first attempt to title the informal's property and 
        bring them into the formal sector, but it is the first such attempt in 
        the third world to work. De Soto documents previous well intentioned efforts, 
        with surveyors, geographic information systems, interviews of informals 
        to ascertain who owns what, and formal title registries backed by the 
        formal legal system -- all the obviously necessary ingredients. Why did 
        these previous attempts all fail? </p>
      <p>Because the formals did not appreciate that the informals already had 
        worked out system of law, rights, and obligations, negotiated over time 
        and idiosyncratic village by village -- <i>the people's law</i>. Instead, 
        the formals approach to the situation was <i>We have a legal system. You 
        don't. Here's ours. </i>Although the title listings reflected a snapshot 
        of who-owns-what, the legal system governing these title listing did nothing 
        to reflect the complex negotiated informal arrangements needed to understand 
        what rights someone actually held to a particular asset. Given this mismatch, 
        the informals proceeded to ignore the formal title registries and trade 
        assets in the way they always had. The title registries were not updated 
        to reflect changes of actual ownership, and so rapidly became even more 
        irrelevant. De Soto's special insight in this situation has been that 
        the government must discover and respect the local laws, and work out, 
        at considerable cost in time and effort, a way to integrate those local 
        laws with the national systems.</p>
      <p> The difficulty comes from an inherent tension between <i>local knowledge</i> 
        and <i>global credibility</i> -- local knowledge of the idiosyncratic 
        people's law, conventions, and negotiated arrangements in force in each 
        village, <i>vs.</i> the need to move the governance of title transfer 
        to WTIIs, whose wide scope requires them to operate from a more homogenized 
        set of rules. This tension is acute on the governmental path, as the homogenized 
        set of rules is not even per title company, but rather the official legal 
        system itself. Governmental legal systems are hardly the wonders of adaptability 
        de Soto's program would seem to require. Even with the best of intentions, 
        an accommodation between the two must rapidly turn into a Procrustean 
        bed. However, de Soto offers no alternative. Though difficult, he is successfully 
        making this path work, and he documents how it did work when formal U.S. 
        law, slowly and painfully, absorbed the informal wild west.</p>
      <p>As if this path were not difficult enough, this whole process faces enormous 
        obstacles from many different factions, notably bureaucracies and lawyers 
        within the national sphere that see this as an assault on their prerogatives, 
        as de Soto also documents. The process never becomes easy: each step of 
        progress is another major upheaval in the perceptions and preferences 
        of entrenched groups dedicated to protecting the status quo.</p>

      <p><font color="#000000"><img src="images/5-bootstrap.gif" width="366" height="214" align="right">Due 
        to the Net, purely electronic goods and services can now be purchased 
        from across the world as easily as from next door. Consumers of these 
        goods and services have already escaped old limits of geography and jurisdiction. 
        If the functions provided by various WTIIs were offered by prominent first 
        world trust hubs as purely electronic services, those in need of such 
        widely trusted intermediary services could escape as well -- escape from 
        the crushing assumption that such services can only be provided by institutions 
        beholden to their own governments. Instead, they could reach across the 
        Net to use these services, and begin to bootstrap themselves out of their 
        poverty by participating in the global networks of commerce. (Figure 5) 
        </font></p>
      <p>Many first world trust hubs are already widely known and plausibly trusted 
        in the third world because of the frenetic distribution efforts of western 
        media: shows ranging from CNN to Dallas and Baywatch have granted an aura 
        of respectability to first world organizations that most governments can 
        only envy. (However one may feel about this process, it is occurring, 
        so we may as well put it to good use.) Using first world WTIIs, villages 
        on a global scale could become part of a global trust network. For example, 
        if a person in village A wants to sell a tractor to a person in village 
        D, a couple of villages away, they could easily use a title registry run 
        by Citibank in New York to execute the transfer. In a similar fashion, 
        the tractor may be securitized, transforming it into capital. And in a 
        state such as Russia, a title listing with Citibank would, ironically, 
        have more legitimacy because the titling institution is beyond the reach 
        of their own government.</p>
      <p>O<font color="#000000">nce the villages of the world join this global 
        village, it will be much easier for them to grow jurisdiction-free high-trust

        by hubs that are already widely trusted. With a working trust backbone, 
        highly trustworthy behavior gets the visibility it needs to more rapidly 
        accumulate its own reputation-capital. </font></p>
      <h3><font color="#000000"><a name="smart-contracts"></a>Smart Contracts</font></h3>
      <p>How might such WTIIs deal with the idiosyncracies of each village's <i>people's 
        law</i>, the idiosyncracies that sabotage traditional governmental attempts 
        to capitalize village assets, without taking on the impossible burden 
        of learning all this local knowledge itself, without imposing the costs 
        of homogenization? By the use of smart contracts.</p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In smart contracts, the program code is an operational 
        embodiment of the contract [<a href="#Szabo97">Szabo97</a>]. A drink vending 
        machine is a very primitive example of a smart contract, being executed 
        on a contract host: it is the partially trusted intermediary between the 
        drink manufacturer and the purchaser. It escrows drinks and money, and 
        performs an exchange of those goods when both have been presented. There 
        is even a rollback process, in which it returns the money if the drink 
        cannot be delivered. Traditional contracts are understood to be backed 
        by a coercive enforcement system made of courts and cops. However, the 
        vending machine does not have the option of such recourse following a 
        breach. In what sense is it a contract?</font></p>
      <p>The vending-machine-as-contract would indeed require separate enforcement 
        if it dispensed the drink first and then demanded payment. However, by 
        escrowing both drinks and payment before dispensing either, it also dispenses 
        with the need for separate enfocement. Instead of enforcement, the contract 
        creates an <i>inescapable arrangement</i>. It cannot prevent the customer 
        from walking away before the game is over, but a customer who walks away 
        from a contract in progress leaves behind any assets escrowed by the contract 
        at that point [<font color="#000000"><a href="#Miller00">Miller00</a>]</font>. 
        The terms of the contract are enforced by the contract itself -- by the 
        behavior of the contract when executed as a program.</p>
      <p>Although conventional coercive recourse is still often possible on the 
        Net, for more and more Net commerce these costs are too great, and the 
        jurisdictional issues potentially too messy. Instead, Net businesses have 
        been engaging in rich and rapid experimentation with cooperative arrangements 
        that require no coercive recourse [<a href="#WhatsHerName"><font color="#FF0000">WhatsHerName</font></a>]. 
        The most common arrangements involve not actual escrow, but reputation 
        feedback and credit [<a href="#Steckbeck01">Steckbeck01</a>]. This has 
        a similar logic, in that a partcipant effectively secures their good performance 
        with the value of their reputation capital. Such arragements are messier 
        and less amenable to automation than escrow, but they do substantially 
        reduce capital costs. Both kinds of arrangements have their place and 
        will compete in the market. Here, I will explore escrow-based smart contracts, 
        not because I expect this form to dominate, but because their logic is 
        vastly easier to explain; because they're easier to build, and so will 
        occur sooner; and because they apply to participants with no prior reputation, 
        which helps for bootstrapping the transition. Likewise, for the electronic 
        systems of title (or <i>issuers</i> below), in this paper I assume systems 
        that provide for instant settlement [<a href="#e-gold">e-gold</a>]. Although 
        delayed settlement may substantially reduce capital costs [<a href="#Selgin01" target="_top">Selgin01</a>], 
        they turn smart contracts into explosions of complexity.</p>
      <h3><font color="#000000"><img src="images/6-exchange.gif" width="390" height="247" align="right"></font>Contracts 
        as Games</h3>
      <p><font color="#000000">A basic metaphor for smart contracts is the board 
        game. When two people negotiate a contract, they are jointly designing 
        the rules of a game they would both be willing to play. Once they commit 
        to playing this game, the players may then make moves, but only moves 
        judged legal by the rules given the current board state. Each move potentially 
        changes the board state, changing which moves are legal during the next 
        turn.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">For example, Figure 6 shows the six possible board 
        states of a simple negotiation and exchange game. Let's say Alice is playing 
        the left side of the board and Bob the right. The initial board state 
        is the one shown on the far left, in which neither of the pieces is on 
        the board. The gold bar, representing money, is off the board on the left, 
        which portrays its possession by Alice at this time. For concreteness, 
        let's say the knight represents stock. Bob might offer a certain amount 
        of stock to Alice by placing it on the right square of the board. This 
        takes us to the board state that's up and right from the initial state. 
        Alice might not respond soon enough, in which case Bob may withdraw his 
        offer by taking back the knight, bringing us back to the initial state. 
        That's why the first transition arrow is shown as bidirectional.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Or Alice may respond to Bob's offer with a certain 
        amount of money, by placing it on the left square of the board. This takes 
        us to the upper right board state. At this point, either party may still 
        decide they're unsatisfied, withdraw their piece, and reenter the loop 
        of bidirectional arrows. Or, in the upper right board state, Bob may pick 
        up the money offered by Alice. Bob has accepted Alice's offer. This is 
        the irreversible commitment step shown by the bold unidirectional arrow, 
        and takes us to the board state down one. From here, the only possible 
        move is for Alice to pick up Bob's knight.</font></p>
      <p>How is this contract self enforcing? What prevents cheating? Who needs 
        to trust whom with what? To answer these questions, we must start by explaining 
        what is happening on whose computer. We assume that each player trusts 
        their own computer (a dangerous assumption, but we cannot proceed without 
        it). We also assume that player A cannot not trust player B's computer 
        any more or less than they trust player B. Under these assumptions, we 
        can treat a computer and its proprietor as a single unit for purposes 
        of analysis.</p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><img src="images/7-duties.gif" width="297" height="299" align="right">The 
        execution of this game actually involves five parties. The two players 
        of course, Alice and Bob. The contract host serves the same role as our 
        vending machine -- it is the third party mutually trusted to execute the 
        contract/program faithfully. The contract can be any program Alice and 
        Bob mutually agree on, written in a safe language suitable for writing 
        smart contracts, that functions as the <i>board manager</i> for the game 
        they have agreed to play. (A <i>board manager</i> for, for example, chess, 
        is a program that enables two people to play with each other, maintains 
        the board state, and only allows legal moves. A board manager does not 
        itself play the game.)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Unlike the vending machine, the contract host need 
        not have any prior knowledge of the contract.</font> Once Alice and Bob 
        agree on the text of a board manager and on a mutually trusted contract 
        host, they upload the board manager to the contract host, which then verifies 
        for them that they've agreed on the same contract, and dispenses to each 
        the right to play their respective sides of the game, shown as the arrows 
        pointing at the respective chairs. The contract can embody the knowledge 
        of acceptable arrangements local to Alice and Bob, local custom, prior 
        handshakes, etc... If the contract host can be trusted at all, it can 
        be trusted to run this contract faithfully, despite its ignorance of the 
        local knowledge that gives this contract meaning. The tension between 
        local knowledge and widespread trust is partially resolved.</p>
      <p>(In the vast majority of cases, one would expect Alice and Bob to select 
        a &quot;boilerplate&quot; contract/program off the shelf and fill in the 
        blanks, rather than write a contract/program from scratch. However, the 
        story of the custom contract better shows the logic by which the system 
        operates, and may explain how these shelves will come to be stocked.)</p>
      <p>The &quot;$-Issuer&quot; and the &quot;Stock-Issuer&quot; turns the movement 
        of the pieces into a transfer of erights. A $-Issuer, or more conventionally 
        a bank, is effectively a title company for money. For money on record 
        at the bank, the rights to the money changes hands by the transfer of 
        quantity between accounts -- shown above as <i>purses</i> within the issuers. 
        When Alice places the gold bar on the board, her computer, the $-Issuer, 
        and the contract host engage in a three-way cryptographic transaction 
        that bring about the transfer of title, at the $-Issuer, of that much 
        money from Alice to the contract host. An honest contract host would consider 
        this money to be only a piece on the board, which can be picked up (transfered 
        to the possession of a player) according to whatever may be the rules 
        of the game. We refer to this as <i>oblivious escrow</i>.</p>
      <p>A dishonest contract host could abscond with the money instead, which 
        is why contract hosts needs to be widely trusted. A widely trusted contract 
        host presumably has a valuable reputation at stake, and this risk helps 
        secure honest behavior. (More sophisticated cryptographic protocols are 
        possible which further limit the player's vulnerability to a dishonest 
        contract host or issuer, but these are beyond the scope of this paper.) 
      </p>
      <p>In the arrangement shown here, the $-Issuer, the Stock-Issuer, and the 
        contract host need not have any prior knowledge or trust of any of the 
        other four players. For the game to be meaningful, Alice and Bob must 
        have prior knowledge and trust in both issuers and the contract host, 
        but not in each other. Even if Alice and Bob are both use-once pseudonymous 
        identities with no apparent physical location [<a href="#Vinge84">Vinge84</a>], 
        under these conditions, they can transact with each other <i>as if</i> 
        they fully trust each other.</p>
      <h3>Assets + Contracts x Time = Capital</h3>
      <p><font color="#000000"><img src="images/8-option.gif" width="379" height="235" align="right">The 
        Smart Contracts explained so far, the vending machine and the exchange 
        game, cannot turn assets into capital. To do so requires contracts that 
        unfold over time, like a mortgage. To explain how such unfolding creates 
        ever more abstract forms of property, a good clear example is the <i>covered 
        call option</i>. (Such instruments are kindergarden finance for many, 
        so excuse us while we belabor the obvious. Re-explaining the familiar 
        is often necessary when translating into a different medium.)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Alice has an <i>option</i> when she has the right, 
        but not the obligation, to engage in some action at some agreed price 
        before some deadline. Alice has a <i>call</i> option when she has the 
        right to buy some agreed asset, let's say stock, at some agreed price 
        before the deadline. The option is a <i>covered</i> call option when Alice's 
        counterparty, Bob, escrows up front the stock Alice may decide to purchase.</font></p>
      <p>We may visualize this as the game shown in Figure 8. In the initial board 
        state, shown in the top left, the stock is already on the board. While 
        in this state, neither Alice nor Bob may pick up the stock. Another &quot;player&quot; 
        in the game, so to speak, is the game clock. Should the deadline expire 
        while in this initial state, the clock causes a transition to a state 
        from which Bob can now pick up his stock and go home.</p>
      <p>Or, before the deadline expires, Alice may decide to <i>exercise</i> 
        the option. She may place a gold piece on the left square. Unlike in the 
        previous game, in this game the acceptable amounts are predetermined by 
        the rules. The left square only accepts a certain amount of money. If 
        Alice places this amount of money on the board, this is the irrevocable 
        commitment step shown as the bold unidirectional arrow. After this move, 
        the only remaining legal moves are for Alice to pick up the stock, and 
        for Bob to pick up the money.</p>
      <p>What is so different about this contract? During the time between when 
        the game starts (when Alice gets access to her chair) and the time when 
        the game transitions to a new board state (either by expiration of the 
        deadline or by exercise of the option), Alice a something valuable. During 
        this interval, Alice has the option to buy this stock. This is a very 
        different kind of value to have than the stock or money themselves. The 
        value of this new right <i>derives</i> from the value of the stock and 
        the money, but whereas they are very simple literal kinds of rights, this 
        new right is somehow more abstract. In Wall Street terminology, the new 
        right is a <i>derivative</i> of the more literal <i>underlying</i> rights. 
        In de Soto's terminology, if the literal instruments are physical <i>assets</i>, 
        then abstract rights derived by contracts about these instruments are 
        <i>capital</i>. </p>
      <p>But there's something missing from this picture. Through the system so 
        far depicted, Alice can trade those rights managed by issuers -- money 
        and stock. The contract host, despite its complete ignorance that it has 
        done so, has created a new valuable right, owned by Alice. But in the 
        picture so far, Alice has no ability to trade this new right. This needs 
        to be repaired, in order for these new rights to truly be capital, and 
        in order for yet more abstract forms of capital to be derived from them.</p>
      <h3><img src="images/9-layering.gif" width="324" height="304" align="right">Networks 
        of Games</h3>
      <p>What we need, quite simply, is an issuer of this new right Alice holds 
        -- the right to sit in the left chair, in order to be able to play the 
        left side of this on-going game. Since the contract host is already managing 
        access to this chair, it seems natural to have it double as the issuer 
        for the right to sit in this chair. Just as Alice could tell the $-Issuer 
        to transfer some of her money from her purse to some else's, we can enable 
        Alice to tell the contract host to transfer her right to sit in this chair 
        to someone else. The contract host would then revoke Alice's access to 
        the chair, and issue fresh access to the new player, much as the $-Issuer 
        does with Alice's money.</p>
      <p>With this ability to compose networks of games, it seems we have the 
        ability to express the full range of contract layering used in modern 
        finance. Not that modern finance is directly relevant to the needs of 
        the poor, but it is a good test of the generality of our framework.</p>
      <p>But wait. This structure decouples knowledge in a way quite different 
        than anything in the financial world. We have the contract host issuing 
        rights it does not understand, since these rights are produced by games 
        it runs, but does not understand. The contract host is not in a position 
        to vouch for any meaningful property of the rights it is issuing, so how 
        can widespread trust in the contract host translate into credible global 
        transferability of derived rights? Let's walk through the example depicted 
        in Figure 9.</p>
      <p>Alice starts out simply as a player of the original options game, hosted 
        by contract host #1. While Alice finds herself in the resulting valuable 
        situation, she manages to find Fred, who would also find this position 
        valuable. Fred, were he convinced that Alice's chair sitting rights mean 
        what Alice says they mean, would be willing to play a game on contract 
        host #3 in which this right, issued by contract host #1, appears as a 
        movable piece. Unfortunately, having just met, Fred and Alice don't trust 
        each any more than Alice and Bob do. Fortunately, Fred does have prior 
        knowledge and trust of contract host #1. Unfortunately, contract host 
        #1 has no idea if the right to sit in this chair of this game means what 
        Alice claims it means, or anything else. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, with Alice's consent, Fred can ask contract host #1 for 
        the text of the contract/program and the current state of the board. In 
        theory, this should be sufficient for Fred to figure out what these derived 
        rights are. Alice, who presumably understands the game she's playing, 
        can help Fred figure this out, and Fred can accept this help, with any 
        trust required between Fred and Alice. Should the contract truly be idiosyncratic 
        to local knowledge shared by Alice and Bob, knowledge to which Fred has 
        no access, he may not find the derived rights comprehensible at reasonable 
        cost and move on. More commonly, if the contract is understandable to 
        some number of others, including some Fred trusts, Fred may turn to them 
        for advice on the contract's meaning -- the computational analog of legal 
        advice.</p>
      <p>This provides for a much more complete resolution of the tension between 
        local knowledge and widespread trust. Previous attempts to title the assets 
        of the informals failed because of the illusion that these assets were 
        merely literal simple property -- physical objects or plots of land. De 
        Soto found instead that these assets were already enmeshed in complex 
        negotiated systems of rights, rules, and obligations that needed to be 
        accomodated, in order for a title listing to be considered meaningful. 
        They are more like our option -- a right produced by a negotiated contractual 
        arrangement -- then they are like the underlying physical objects one 
        would point at. Smart contract can capture some sense of these negotiated 
        arrangements. They will still form a procrustean bed of a sort, because 
        not all terms will be expressible to this new language. But homogenization 
        is not needed -- vast variation is expressible within this language, and 
        we may hope that leaves room enough to capture much of the local knowledge 
        and arrangements that would otherwise have been lost.</p>
      <p>For whatever aspect of these arrangements does get captured in these 
        smart contracts, by uploading these contracts into widely trusted contract 
        hosts, we achieve credibility of title transfer at a distance. These will 
        create their own pressures for homogenization: Alice did not lose the 
        sale to Fred from lack of trust -- under the stated assumptions, our architecture 
        took care of that. Rather, she may have lost him through her inability 
        to explain what she was selling. But these pressures for homogenization 
        can exerpt their influence, or not, after the basic transition is made. 
      </p>
      <p>(If this tale seems implausibly complex, please keep in mind that each 
        of the player is presumed to be participating through a software system 
        well engineered to hide complexity when it can, and make the issues intuitive 
        when it can't. Vastly more complex internal architectures have been made 
        to seem simple and come to be widely used.)</p>

      <h3><a name="blockbuster"></a>Smart Contracting for the First World</h3>
      <p>Smart Contracting is not just a good idea for the third world. In technological 
        western civilization as well, smart contracts can wring new efficiencies 
        from the economy. An example can be seen in the way a new special-purpose 
        contract host was able to change the dynamics of the videotape rental 
        industry in the 90s: </p>
      <p>When videotape rental first emerged as a business, movie producers charged 
        the rental stores extremely high prices for movies. The rental stores 
        inevitably responded by buying as small a number of copies of each movie 
        as they could, and reusing those tapes as long as they dared. The consequence 
        for the consumer was that videos of newly-released movies were scarce, 
        and the videos of long-released movies were in poor condition.</p>
      <p>How did we get to the current state of affairs, in which BlockBuster 
        routinely guarantees availability of brand new movies? By bringing out 
        a new cash register: a cash register that automatically tracked a per-rental 
        fee and transmitted it to the studio. With these cash registers acting 
        as trusted third party contract hosts, the rental stores were able to 
        persuade the producers to change their pricing model. Since the actual 
        manufacture of the video tape was inexpensive, and since the studios were 
        confident that their cut each transaction was protected, the studios began 
        giving the rental stores movies at nominal prices, encouraging the rental 
        stores to maintain quantity and quality at dramatically higher levels. 
      </p>
      <h3><a name="ruleoflaw"></a>The Rule of Law, Not Of Men</h3>
      <p>What does smart contracting do to the next brick? The next brick that 
        must be removed from the world is the brick that prevents the long-distance 
        credible right of property transfer. We remove this brick by moving the 
        village to Cyberspace: placing the local village on the Net, adjacent 
        to the globally recognized WTIIs already present there, and enabling the 
        implementation of smart contracts filled with local knowledge on an impartial 
        contract host continents away. Once this transition takes place, we will 
        see that jurisdiction-based law, even when nation-wide, is crippled in 
        the same way that village-wide law is crippled. The third world will then 
        ironically lead the first world into a brighter place with fewer bricks 
        than society has ever had before. Just as in phone systems, if you have 
        no land line system, you are more likely to leap over such infrastructure 
        development and go directly to cell phones, so too is the third world 
        more likely to leap across national jurisdictional systems, and go directly 
        to the high-efficiency, low friction, strongly impartial, extremely corruption-resistant, 
        non-jurisdictional legal systems of the future. It will bring us a giant 
        step closer to a world governed by the rule of law, not of men.</p>
