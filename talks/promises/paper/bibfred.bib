 Abstract = "
This textbook is designed for second-year courses up to graduate
courses in computer programming.  It covers all major programming
concepts, techniques, and paradigms in a unified framework.  It
is based on the kernel language approach, in which
programming languages are defined in terms of their underlying
concepts.  The textbook defines a wide variety of programming
languages and paradigms with a small set of closely-related
kernel languages.  The kernel languages are easy to understand by
practicing programmers and have a simple formal semantics that
makes it easy to reason about correctness and complexity at a
high level of abstraction.  The textbook is designed to be used
together with the Mozart Programming System."

  Search can be speeded up by exploring subtrees of a search tree
  in parallel. This paper presents distributed search engines
  that achieve parallelism by distribution across networked
  computers.  The main point of the paper is a simple design of
  the parallel search engine. Simplicity comes as an immediate
  consequence of clearly separating search, concurrency, and
  distribution. The obtained distributed search engines are
  simple yet offer substantial speedup on standard network
  computers.},
