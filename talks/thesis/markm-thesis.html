<!--l. 4--><p class="indent">   When separately written programs are composed so that they may cooperate, they may
instead destructively interfere in unanticipated ways. These hazards limit the scale and
functionality of the software systems we can successfully compose. This dissertation presents a
framework--a computational model and a set of design rules--for enabling those interactions
between components needed for the cooperation we intend, while minimizing the hazards of
destructive interference.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent">   Most of the progress to date on the composition problem has been made in the context of
sequential, single-machine programming among benign components. Within this limited
context, object programming supports composition well. This dissertation explains and
builds on this success, showing how to extend the object paradigm to support robust
composition of concurrent and potentially malicious components distributed over potentially
malicious machines. We present E, a distributed, persistent, secure programming language,
and CapDesk, a virus-safe desktop built in E, as embodiments of the techniques we
explain.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent">   As Alan Kay has suggested <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xkay:ma">Kay98</a>]</span>, our explanation of the power of object
programming will focus not on the objects themselves, but on the reference graph
that connects them. In the object model of computation, an object can affect
the world outside itself only by sending messages to objects it holds references
to.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="markm-thesis2.html#fn1x1"><sup >1</sup></a></span> <a 
 id="x1-3f1"></a> 
The references that an object may come to hold thereby limit what effects it may cause. Our
extensions to the object paradigm leverage this observation. References become the sole
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
conveyers of (overt) inter-object causality, yielding the object-capability model of access
control (Chapter&nbsp;<a 
href="#x1-115r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:acc-objcap --></a>), able to support certain patterns of composition among potentially
malicious objects. We extend the reference graph cryptographically between potentially
mutually malicious machines, yielding a distributed cryptographic capability system
(Chapter&nbsp;<a 
href="#x1-93r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:con-pluribus --></a>).
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent">   A particularly vexing set of problems in distributed systems are the issues of partial failure
(spontaneous disconnection and crashes). The most novel contribution of this dissertation is
the definition of a state transition semantics for distributed references that supports
deferred communication, failure notification, and reconnection while preserving useful
limits on causal transmission. We define a set of reference states, <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">i.e.</span>, states that a
reference may be in, and a set of associated transition rules, where the causal transmission
properties provided by a reference depend on its state (Chapter&nbsp;<a 
href="#x1-223r17">17<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:con-partial-failure --></a>). The resulting
access-control and concurrency-control discipline helps us cope with the following pressing
problems:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Excessive authority which invites abuse (such as viruses and spyware),
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Inconsistency caused by interleaving (concurrency),
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Deadlock (though other forms of lost progress hazards remain),
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Inter-machine latency, and
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Partial failure (disconnects and crashes).</li></ul>
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent">   Some prior means of addressing these problems are similar to those presented in this
dissertation. However, these prior solutions have not been composed successfully into a framework
for simultaneously addressing these problems. Our comparative success at realizing an integrated
solution is due to two observations:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li class="enumerate" value="1" 
><a 
 id="x1-5x1"></a>Both access control and concurrency control are about enabling the causality needed
     for the inter-object cooperation we intend, while seeking to prevent those interactions
     which might cause destructive interference. In access control, we seek to distribute
     those access rights needed for the job at hand, while limiting the distribution of access
     rights that would enable mischief. In concurrency control, we seek to enable those
     interleavings needed for continued progress, while preventing those interleavings that
     would cause inconsistency.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" value="2" 
><a 
 id="x1-7x2"></a>References are already the natural means for enabling inter-object causality, so a
     natural and powerful means of limiting inter-object causality is to restrict the causal
     transmission properties provided by references.</li></ol>
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent">   We show how the consistent application of these principles, simultaneously, at multiple scales
of composition, results in a multiplicative reduction in overall systemic vulnerability to plan
interference.

<!--l. 18--><p class="indent">   In an object system (Figure&nbsp;<a 
href="#x1-11r1">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:unattenuated-first --></a>), when object Alice says <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">bob.foo(carol)</span>, she invokes object
Bob, passing as argument a reference to object Carol. By passing this reference, Alice composes
Bob with Carol, so that their interaction will serve some purpose of Alice&#8217;s. The argument
reference enables Bob to interact with Carol.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent">   By restricting inter-object causality to flow only by messages sent on references, Bob&#8217;s
authority is limited according to the references he comes to hold. If Bob cannot interact with
Carol unless he holds a reference to Carol, then the reference graph from the programming
language literature <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">is </span>the access graph from the access control literature. When references can
only be transmitted and acquired by the rules of the object programming model, this
results in the object-capability model of secure computation. This model has been
represented by concrete designs for over forty years, but previous attempts to state
the model abstractly have left out crucial elements. A contribution of Chapter&nbsp;<a 
href="#x1-115r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:acc-objcap --></a> is
to present a single model, abstract enough to describe both prior object-capability
languages and operating systems, and concrete enough to describe authority-manipulating
behavior.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent">   Alice&#8217;s purpose requires Bob and Carol to interact in certain ways. Even within the
object-capability restrictions, this reference provides Bob unattenuated authority to access Carol:
It gives Bob a perpetual and unconditional ability to invoke Carol&#8217;s public operations. This may
allow interactions well beyond those that serve Alice&#8217;s purposes, including interactions
harmful to Alice&#8217;s interests. If Alice could enable just those interactions needed for her
purposes, then, if things go awry, the damage that follows might be usefully isolated and
limited.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent">   This dissertation explores several mechanisms by which the authority Alice provides to Bob

cannot be enforced between mutually suspicious machines on open networks. Our overall system
consists of object-capability islands sending messages to each other over a cryptographic
capability sea. A contribution of this section is to introduce a unified account of access control in
such a mixed system.

<!--l. 129--><p class="indent">   E&#8217;s concurrency control is based on communicating event loops. Each vat has a heap of
objects, a call-return stack, a queue of pending deliveries, and a single thread of control. An
immediate-call pushes a new stack frame, transferring control there. An eventual-send enqueues a
new pending delivery--a pair of a message and the target object to deliver it to--on the pending
delivery queue of the vat hosting the target. A vat&#8217;s thread is a loop, dequeueing the next pending
delivery and invoking the target with the message. Each of these invocations spawns a <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">turn</span>, which
runs to completion as a conventional sequential program, changing vat state and enqueuing new
pending deliveries. All user-level code runs in these turns, including all state access and
modification.
