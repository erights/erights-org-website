    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      When separately written programs are composed so that they may
      cooperate, they may instead destructively interfere in
      unanticipated ways. These hazards limit the scale and
      functionality of the software systems we can successfully
      compose. This dissertation presents a framework for enabling
      those interactions between components needed for the cooperation
      we intend, while minimizing the hazards of destructive
      interference.

      Great progress on the composition problem has been made within
      the object paradigm, chiefly in the context of sequential,
      single-machine programming among benign components. We show how
      to extend this success to support robust composition of
      concurrent and potentially malicious components distributed over
      potentially malicious machines. We present E, a distributed,
      persistent, secure programming language, and CapDesk, a
      virus-safe desktop built in E, as embodiments of the techniques
      we explain.
