    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
    <p>
      Jonathan Shapiro, my advisor, for encouraging me to continue this work
      in an academic setting, and for providing insight, encouragement, and
      support way beyond the call of any duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry Stanley, for her patient support, encouragement, and
      enthusiam for this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      My parents, Ann and Bernard Miller. Knowing the naches they
      would feel, helped motivate me to complete this dissertation
      (``Naches'' is approximately ``reflected pride'').
    </p>
    <p>
      Hewlett-Packard Laboratories for supporting portions of this
      research, and Alan Karp for helping to arrange this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combex and Henry Boreen for investing in these ideas. I still
      hope to see this investment pay off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for sponsoring the
      security review of E, CapDesk, and the DarpaBrowser [WT02].
    </p>
    <p>
      Lauren Williams for rescue from crisis. I don't know what would
      have happened without your help.

      The software systems explained in this dissertation are the
      results of collaborative efforts starting at Electric
      Communities, Inc. and continuing with the e-lang online
      community. Since the contributors are many and changing, they
      are accurately documented only by navigation from
      erights.org. Here, I'd like to single out and express my
      gratitude specifically to E's most creative and prolific user,
      Marc Stiegler. He is the creator and primary developer of the
      systems documented in Part&nbsp;IV: CapDesk, Polaris,
      and the DarpaBrowser. Without his contributions, the value of E
      would have remained inaccessibly abstract.

      This dissertation borrows liberally from several of my previous
      papers [MMF00, MYS03, MTS04, MTS05]. Without further
      attribution, I'd like to especially thank my co-authors on these
      papers: Bill Frantz, Chip Morningstar, Jonathan Shapiro, E. Dean
      Tribble, Bill Tulloh, and Ka-Ping Yee.  I cannot hope to
      enumerate all their contributions to the ideas presented here.
    </p>

      Thanks to Ka-Ping Yee and David Hopwood for a wide variety of
      assistance. They reviewed numerous drafts, contributed extensive and
      deep technical feedback, clarifying rephrasings, crisp illustrations,
      and moral support.

      Ka-Ping Yee contributed Figures 14.2, 14.3, 16.1, and 17.1 with
      input from the e-lang community.

      Thanks to Terry Stanley for suggesting the listener pattern and
      purchase-order examples.

      Thanks to Marc Stiegler for the membrane example shown in
      Figure 9.3.

      Thanks to Darius Bacon for the promise pipelining example shown
      in Figure 16.1.

      Thanks to Mark Seaborn for suggesting that the when-catch
      expression evaluate to a promise for its handler's result, as
      explained in Section 18.1.

      Thanks to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, for choosing
      the perfect port number for Pluribus on their own.

      Thanks to Norm Hardy for bringing to my attention the
      relationship between knowledge and authority in computational
      systems.
