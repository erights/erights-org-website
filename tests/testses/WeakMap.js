/**
 * @fileoverview Install a leaky WeakMap emulation on platforms that
 * don't provide a built-in one.
 *
 * <p>Assumes that an ES5 platform where, if {@code WeakMap} is
 * already present, then it conforms to the anticipated ES6
 * specification. To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5
 * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not
 * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.

/**
 * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the
 * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.
 *
 * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not
 * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not
 * retain the keys it indexes. A key by itself also does not retain
 * the values associated with that key.
 *
 * <p>However, the values placed in an emulated WeakMap are retained
 * so long as that map is retained and those associations are not
 * overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all
 * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime
 * of the membrane. But when the membrane is revoked, all objects
 * encapsulated within that membrane will still be collected. This
 * is the best we can do without VM support.
 *
 * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
 * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,
 * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):
 * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API
 * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.
 *
 * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in
 * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,
 * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent
 * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive
 * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods
 * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,
 * an object of {@code [[Class]]} "WeakMap}), since there is nothing
 * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,
 * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being
 * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same
 * names.
 *
 * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code
 * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the
 * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap
 * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications
 * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this
 * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to
 * prevent access to this channel. (See
 * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).

   *
   * <p>Two keys that are <a href=
   * "http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:egal">egal</a>
   * MUST have the same {@code identity}. Two keys that are not egal
   * MUST either have different identities, or at least one of their
   * identities MUST be {@code NO_IDENT}.
   *
   * An identity is either a string or a const function returning a
   * mostly-unique string. The identity of an object is always either
   * NO_IDENT or such a function. The egal-identity of the function
   * itself is used to resolve collisions on the string returned by
   * the function. If the key is not an object (i.e., a primitive,
   * null, or undefined), then identity(key) throws a TypeError.
   *
   * <p>When a map stores a key's identity rather than the key itself,
   * the map does not cause the key to be retained. See the emulated
   * {@code WeakMap} below for the resulting gc properties.
   *
   * <p>To identify objects with reasonable efficiency on ES5 by
   * itself (i.e., without any object-keyed collections), we need to
   * add a reasonably hidden property to such key objects when we
   * can. This raises three issues:
   * <ul>
   * <li>arranging to add this property to objects before we lose the
   *     chance, and
   * <li>reasonably hiding the existence of this new property from
   *     most JavaScript code.
   * <li>Preventing <i>identity theft</i>, where one object is created
   *     falsely claiming to have the identity of another object.
   * </ul>
   * We do so by
   * <ul>
   * <li>Making the hidden property non-enumerable, so we need not
   *     worry about for-in loops or {@code Object.keys},
   * <li>Making the hidden property an accessor property,
   *     where the hidden property's getter is the identity, and the
   *     value the getter returns is the mostly unique string.
   * <li>monkey patching those reflective methods that would
   *     prevent extensions, to add this hidden property first,
   * <li>monkey patching those methods that would reveal this
   *     hidden property, and
   * <li>monkey patching those methods that would overwrite this
   *     hidden property.
   * </ul>
   * Given our parser-less verification strategy, the remaining
   * non-transparencies which are not easily fixed are
   * <ul>
   * <li>The {@code delete}, {@code in}, property access
   *     ({@code []}, and {@code .}), and property assignment
   *     operations each reveal the presence of the hidden
   *     property. The property access operations also reveal the
   *     randomness provided by {@code Math.random}. This is not
   *     currently an issue but may become one if SES otherwise seeks
   *     to hide {@code Math.random}.
   * </ul>
   * These are not easily fixed because they are primitive operations
   * which cannot be monkey patched. However, because we're
   * representing the precious identity by the identity of the
   * property's getter rather than the value gotten, this identity
   * itself cannot leak or be installed by the above non-transparent
   * operations.
