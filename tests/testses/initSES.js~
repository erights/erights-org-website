/**
 * @fileoverview Install a leaky WeakMap emulation on platforms that
 * don't provide a built-in one.
 */

/**
 * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the
 * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.
 *
 * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not
 * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not
 * retain the keys it indexes. A key by itself also does not retain
 * the values associated with that key.
 *
 * <p>However, the values placed in an emulated WeakMap are retained
 * so long as that map is retained and those associations are not
 * overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all
 * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime
 * of the membrane. But when the membrane is revoked, all objects
 * encapsulated within that membrane will still be collected. This
 * is the best we can do without VM support.
 *
 * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented
 * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,
 * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):
 * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API
 * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.
 *
 * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in
 * FF6.0a1 is the presence on non enumerable {@code get___, has___,
 * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent
 * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive
 * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods
 * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,
 * and object of {@code [[Class]]} "WeakMap}), since there is nothing
 * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,
 * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being
 * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same
 * names.
 *
 * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code
 * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A
 * problem with the current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is
 * itself a WeakMap providing ambient mutability and an ambient
 * communications channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and
 * has this problem, es5shim.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order
 * to prevent access to this channel. (See
 * PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in es5shim.js).

   *
   * <p>Two keys that are <a href=
   * "http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:egal">egal</a>
   * MUST have the same {@code identity}. Two keys that are not egal
   * MUST either have different identities, or at least one of their
   * identities MUST be {@code NO_IDENT}.
   *
   * <p><b>Plan</b>: An identity is either a string or a const
   * function returning a mostly-unique string. The identity of an
   * object is always either NO_IDENT or such a function. The
   * egal-identity of the function itself is used to resolve
   * collisions on the string returned by the function. For now, if
   * the key is not an object (i.e., a primitive, null, or undefined),
   * then identity(key) throws a TypeError.
   *
   * <p><b>What's currently implemented</b>: An identity is either a
   * string or a frozen singleton array containing a mostly-unique
   * string. The identity of an object is always either NO_IDENT or
   * such an array. The egal-identity of the array itself is used to
   * resolve collisions on the string within the array.
   *
   * <p>When a map stores a key's identity rather than the key itself,
   * the map does not cause the key to be retained. See the emulated
   * {@code WeakMap} below for the resulting gc properties.
   *
   * <p>To identify objects with reasonable efficiency on ES5 by
   * itself (i.e., without any object-keyed collections), we need to
   * add a reasonably hidden property to such key objects when we
   * can. This raises three issues:
   * <ul>
   * <li>arranging to add this property to objects before we lose the
   *     chance, and
   * <li>reasonably hiding the existence of this new property from
   *     most JavaScript code.
   * <li><b>Unimplemented plan</b> preventing <i>identity theft</i>,
   *     where one object is created falsely claiming to have the
   *     identity of another object.
   * </ul>
   * We do so by
   * <ul>
   * <li>Making the hidden property non-enumerable, so we need not
   *     worry about for-in loops or {@code Object.keys},
   * <li><b>Plan</b>: Making the hidden property an accessor property,
   *     where the hidden property's getter is the identity, and the
   *     value the getter returns is the mostly unique string.
   * <li>monkey patching those reflective methods that would
   *     prevent extensions, to add this hidden property first,
   * <li>monkey patching those methods that would reveal this
   *     hidden property, and
   * <li>monkey patching those methods that would overwrite this
   *     hidden property.
   * </ul>
   * Given our parser-less verification strategy, the remaining
   * non-transparencies which are not easily fixed are
   * <ul>
   * <li>The {@code delete}, {@code in}, property access
   *     ({@code []}, and {@code .}), and property assignment
   *     operations each reveal the presence of the hidden
   *     property. The property access operations also reveal the
   *     randomness provided by {@code Math.random}. This not
   *     currently an issue but may become one if SES otherwise seeks
   *     to hide Math.random.
   * </ul>
   * These are not easily fixed because they are primitive operations
   * which cannot be monkey patched. However, because (<b>Plan</b>)
   * we're representing the precious identity by the identity of the
   * property's getter rather than the value gotten, this identity
   * itself cannot leak or be installed by the above non-transparent
   * operations.
   *
   * <p>Due to <a href=
   * "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=637994">Bug:
   * Inherited accessor properties (sometimes?) reported as own
   * properties</a> we're reverting the logic of <a href=

/**
 * @fileoverview Exports "whitelist", a recursively defined JSON
 * record enumerating all the naming paths in the ES5.1 spec, those
 * de-facto extensions that we judge to be safe, and SES and Dr. SES
 * extensions provided by the SES runtime.
 *
 * <p>Each JSON record enumerates the disposition of the properties on
 * some corresponding primordial object, with the root record
 * representing the global object. For each such record, the values
 * associated with its property names can be
 * <ul>
 * <li>Another record, in which case this property is simply
 *     whitelisted and that next record represents the disposition of
 *     the object which is its value. For example, {@code "Object"}
 *     leads to another record explaining what properties {@code
 *     "Object"} may have and how each of such property, if present,
 *     and its value should be tamed.
 * <li>true, in which case this property is simply whitelisted. The
 *     value associated with that property is still traversed and
 *     tamed, but only according to the taming of the objects that
 *     object inherits from. For example, {@code "Object.freeze"} leads
 *     to true, meaning that the {@code "freeze"} property of {@code
 *     Object} should be whitelisted and the value of the property (a
 *     function) should be further tamed only according to the
 *     markings of the other objects it inherits from, like {@code
 *     "Function.prototype"} and {@code "Object.prototype").
 * <li>"*", in which case this property on this object is whitelisted,
 *     as is this property as inherited by all objects that inherit
 *     from this object. The values associated with all such properties
 *     are still traversed and tamed, but only according to the taming
 *     of the objects that object inherits from. For example, {@code
 *     "Object.prototype.constructor"} leads to "*", meaning that we
 *     whitelist the {@code "constructor"} property on {@code
 *     Object.prototype} and on every object that inherits from {@code
 *     Object.prototype} that does not have a conflicting mark. Each
 *     of these is tamed as if with true, so that the value of the
 *     property is further tamed according to what other objects it
 *     inherits from.
 * <li>"skip", in which case this property on this object is simply
 *     whitelisted, as is this property as inherited by all objects
 *     that inherit from this object, but we avoid taming the value
 *     associated with that property. For example, as of this writing
 *     {@code "Function.prototype.caller"} leads to "skip" because
 *     some current browser bugs prevent us from removing or even
 *     traversing this property on some platforms of interest.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The "skip" markings are workarounds for browser bugs or other
 * temporary problems. For each of these, there should be an
 * explanatory comment explaining why or a bug citation
 * (TODO(erights)). Any of these whose comments say "fatal" need to be
 * fixed before SES might be considered safe. Ideally, we can retire
 * all "skip" entries by the time SES is ready for secure production
 * use.
 *
 * The members of the whitelist are either
 * <ul>
 * <li>(uncommented) defined by the ES5.1 normative standard text,
 * <li>(questionable) provides a source of non-determinism, in
 *     violation of pure object-capability rules, but allowed anyway
 *     since we've given up on restricting JavaScript to a
 *     deterministic subset.
 * <li>(ES5 Appendix B) common elements of de facto JavaScript
 *     described by the non-normative Appendix B.
 * <li>(Harmless whatwg) extensions documented at
 *     <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript"
 *     >http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript</a> that seem to be
 *     harmless. Note that the RegExp constructor extensions on that
 *     page are <b>not harmless</b> and so must not be whitelisted.
 * <li>(ES-Harmony proposal) accepted as "proposal" status for
 *     EcmaScript-Harmony.
 * <li>(Marked as "skip") See above.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>With the above encoding, there are some sensible whitelists we
 * cannot express, such as marking a property both with "*" and a JSON
 * record. This is an expedient decision based only on not having
 * encountered such a need. Should we need this extra expressiveness,
 * we'll need to refactor to enable a different encoding.
 *
 * <p>We factor out {@code true} and {@code "skip"} into the variables
 * {@code t} and {@code s} just to get a bit better compression from
 * simple minifiers.

 *
 * <p>The original global binding of {@code eval} is not
 * SES-safe. {@code cajaVM.eval} is a safe wrapper around this
 * original eval, enforcing SES language restrictions.
 *
 * <p>If TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is true, both the global {@code eval}
 * variable, and the pseudo-global {@code "eval"} property of root,
 * are set to the safe wrapper. If TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is false, in order
 * to work around a bug in the Chrome debugger, then the global {@code
 * eval} is unaltered and no {@code "eval"} property is available on
 * root. In either case, SES-evaled-code and SES-script-code can both
 * access the safe eval wrapper as {@code cajaVM.eval}.
 *
 * <p>By making the safe eval available on root only when we also make
 * it be the genuine global eval, we preserve the property that
 * SES-evaled-code differs from SES-script-code only by having a
 * subset of the same variables in globalish scope. This is a
 * nice-to-have that makes explanation easier rather than a hard
 * requirement. With this property, any SES-evaled-code that does not
 * fail to access a global variable (or to test whether it could)
 * should operate the same way when run as SES-script-code.

 * synchronous interface of the evaluation APIs (currently {@code
 * eval, Function, cajaVM.{compile, compileModule, eval, Function}})
 * cannot reasonably be provided. Instead, under translation we expect
 * <ul>
 * <li>Not to have a binding for the pseudo-global {@code "eval"} on root,

 * <li>The global {@code eval} seen by scripts is either unaltered (to

 *     EvalError diagnostic (if TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is true).
 * <li>The global {@code Function} constructor, both as seen by script
 *     code and evaled code, to throw an appropriate diagnostic.
 * <li>The {@code Q} API to always be available, to handle
 *     asyncronous, promise, and remote requests.
 * <li>The evaluating methods on {@code cajaVM} -- currently {@code
 *     compile, compileModule, eval, and Function} -- to be remote
 *     promises for their normal interfaces, which therefore must be
 *     invoked with {@code Q.post}.
 * <li>Since {@code Q.post} can be used for asynchronously involing
 *     non-promises, invocations like
 *     {@code Q.post(cajaVM, 'eval', ['2+3'])}, for example,
 *     will return a promise for a 5. This will work both under Caja
 *     translation and (TODO(erights)) under SES verification when
 *     {@code Q} is also installed, and so is the only portable
 *     evaluating API that SES code should use during this transition
 *     period.
 * <li>TODO(erights): {code Q.post(cajaVM, 'compileModule',
 *     [moduleSrc]} should eventually pre-load the transitive
 *     synchronous dependencies of moduleSrc before resolving the
 *     promise for its result. It currently does not, instead

 * spec. The ES5 spec allows browsers to implement more than is
 * specified as long as certain invariants are maintained. We further
 * assume that these extensions are not maliciously designed to obey

 *        emulating the safe subset of the normal global object.
 * @param whitelist ::Record(Permit) where Permit = true | "*" |

 *        navigating these paths starting from this root. All
 *        non-whitelisted properties of accessible primordials are
