 *
 * <p>Under server-side Caja translation for old pre-ES5 browsers, the
 * synchronous interface of the evaluation APIs (currently {@code
 * eval, Function, cajaVM.{compile, compileModule, eval, Function}})
 * cannot reasonably be provided. Instead, under translation we expect
 * <ul>
 * <li>Not to have a binding for the pseudo-global {@code "eval"} on root,
 *     just as we would not if TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is false.
 * <li>The global {@code eval} seen by scripts is either unaltered (to
 *     work around the Chrome debugger bug if TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is
 *     false), or is replaced by a function that throws an appropriate
 *     EvalError diagnostic (if TAME_GLOBAL_EVAL is true).
 * <li>The global {@code Function} constructor, both as seen by script
 *     code and evaled code, to throw an appropriate diagnostic.
 * <li>The {@code Q} API to always be available, to handle
 *     asyncronous, promise, and remote requests.
 * <li>The evaluating methods on {@code cajaVM} -- currently {@code
 *     compile, compileModule, eval, and Function} -- to be remote
 *     promises for their normal interfaces, which therefore must be
 *     invoked with {@code Q.post}.
 * <li>Since {@code Q.post} can be used for asynchronously invoking
 *     non-promises, invocations like
 *     {@code Q.post(cajaVM, 'eval', ['2+3'])}, for example,
 *     will return a promise for a 5. This will work both under Caja
 *     translation and (TODO(erights)) under SES verification when
 *     {@code Q} is also installed, and so is the only portable
 *     evaluating API that SES code should use during this transition
 *     period.
 * <li>TODO(erights): {code Q.post(cajaVM, 'compileModule',
 *     [moduleSrc]} should eventually pre-load the transitive
 *     synchronous dependencies of moduleSrc before resolving the
 *     promise for its result. It currently does not, instead
 *     requiring its client to do so manually.

 */
var cajaVM;

/**
 * <p>{@code ses.startSES} should be called before any other potentially

 *
 * <p>If {@code ses.startSES} succeeds, the evaluation operations on
 * {@code cajaVM}, the global {@code Function} contructor, and perhaps
 * the {@code eval} function (see doc-comment on {@code eval} and
 * {@code cajaVM}) will only load code according to the <i>loader
 * isolation</i> rules of the object-capability model, suitable for
 * loading untrusted code. If all other (trusted) code executed
 * directly in this frame (i.e., other than through these safe
 * evaluation operations) takes care to uphold object-capability
 * rules, then untrusted code loaded via these safe evaluation
 * operations will be constrained by those rules. TODO(erights):
 * explain concretely what the trusted code must do or avoid doing to
 * uphold object-capability rules.
 *
 * <p>On a pre-ES5 platform, this script will fail cleanly, leaving
 * the frame intact. Otherwise, if this script fails, it may leave
 * this frame in an unusable state. All following description assumes
 * this script succeeds and that the browser conforms to the ES5
 * spec. The ES5 spec allows browsers to implement more than is
 * specified as long as certain invariants are maintained. We further
 * assume that these extensions are not maliciously designed to obey
 * the letter of these invariants while subverting the intent of the
 * spec. In other words, even on an ES5 conformant browser, we do not
 * presume to defend ourselves from a browser that is out to get us.
 *
 * @param global ::Record(any) Assumed to be the real global object
 *        for this frame. Since {@code ses.startSES} will allow global
 *        variable references that appear at the top level of the
 *        whitelist, our safety depends on these variables being
 *        frozen as a side effect of freezing the corresponding
 *        properties of {@code global}. These properties are also
 *        duplicated onto the virtual global objects which are
 *        provided as the {@code this} binding for the safe
 *        evaluation calls -- emulating the safe subset of the normal
 *        global object.
 * @param whitelist ::Record(Permit) where Permit = true | "*" |
 *        "skip" | Record(Permit).  Describes the subset of naming
 *        paths starting from the root that should be accessible. The
 *        <i>accessible primordials</i> are all values found by
 *        navigating these paths starting from this root. All
 *        non-whitelisted properties of accessible primordials are
 *        deleted, and then the root and all accessible primordials
 *        are frozen with the whitelisted properties frozen as data
 *        properties. TODO(erights): fix the code and documentation to
 *        also support confined-ES5, suitable for confining
 *        potentially offensive code but not supporting defensive
 *        code, where we skip this last freezing step. With
 *        confined-ES5, each frame is considered a separate protection
 *        domain rather that each individual object.
 * @param atLeastFreeVarNames ::F([string], Record(true))
 *        Given the sourceText for a strict Program,
 *        atLeastFreeVarNames(sourceText) returns a Record whose
 *        enumerable own property names must include the names of all the
 *        free variables occuring in sourceText. It can include as
 *        many other strings as is convenient so long as it includes
 *        these. The value of each of these properties should be
 *        {@code true}. TODO(erights): On platforms with Proxies
 *        (currently only Firefox 4 and after), use {@code
 *        with(aProxy) {...}} to intercept free variables rather than
 *        atLeastFreeVarNames.
 * @param extensions ::F([], Record(any)]) A function returning a
 *        record whose own properties will be copied onto cajaVM. This
 *        is used for the optional components which bring SES to
 *        feature parity with the ES5/3 runtime at the price of larger
 *        code size. At the time that {@code startSES} calls {@code
 *        extensions}, {@code cajaVM} exists but should not yet be
 *        used. In particular, {@code extensions} should not call
 *        {@code cajaVM.def} when called, because def would then
 *        freeze priordials before startSES cleans them (removes
 *        non-whitelisted properties). The methods that
 *        {@code extensions} contributes can, of course, use
 *        {@code cajaVM}, since those methods will only be called once
