<p><font color="#008000"><b>Testers who are writing load test
scripts</b></font>. Load test scripts are characterized by
longish sequences of fairly simple activities that are repeated
essentially forever. Multiple scripts are run simultaneously.</p>

<ul>
    <li>by &quot;longish&quot;, I mean 15-20 steps such as
        &quot;pick up an object&quot;, &quot;dance&quot;,
        &quot;emote&quot;. </li>
    <li>by &quot;fairly simple&quot;, I mean that things such as
        precise placement in particular locations are not
        important. Timing is not important.</li>
    <li>Scripts have little control flow. There are three main
        types:</li>
    <li><ul>
            <li>the outer loop, which is just a &quot;while(true)
                {}&quot; There are probably setup commands before
                the loop.</li>
            <li><u>if</u> (<i>expected result happens</i>) <i>check
                it and continue</i> <br>
                <u>else</u> <i>handle error (probably by
                quitting).</i></li>
            <li><u>if</u> (<i>first expected result happens</i>) <i>check
                it and continue</i> <br>
                <u>else if </u>(<i>second expected result happens</i>)
                <i>check it and continue <br>
                </i><u>else</u> <i>handle error (probably by
                quitting).</i></li>
            <li>Quite often no checking is done in <i>check it
                and continue.</i></li>
            <li>The load tester doesn't care much whether the
                scripts are written in the command language or in
                some other, external language (e.g., perl or
                expect).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Click here for a sample load-test script. (missing)</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>Testers writing smoke test scripts. </b></font>These
will be essentially the same as load test scripts, except:</p>

<ul>
    <li>they won't be run in a loop.</li>
    <li>they may do more result checking.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>(MAYBE) Testers writing functional
tests of world objects. </b></font>These tests will probably do
more result checking, but are likely to use the same commands as
other tests. This is a &quot;maybe&quot; because I'm skeptical
that we'll have a lot of automated tests - probably most will be
manual (except for the smoke tests). </p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>(MAYBE) Testers writing manual tests
of the product. </b></font>These would be used only for tests
that couldn't easily be executed through the GUI. The only
example I can think of would be tests that require pixel-perfect
positioning (&quot;click on the very edge of the floor&quot;).</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><b>(MAYBE) Testers setting up manual
tests. </b></font>For a given manual test, it might be convenient
to create 87 different objects and scatter them around the room
or do similar things. Note that such a test could still be done
without looping constructs. I don't know how much this will be
needed vs. just creating them manually and saving the world state
(across releases, mind you).</p>

<h3>users to ignore (tentative)</h3>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>White-box testers.</b></font> It <u>may</u>
be feasible, in some cases, to aid white box testing if the CLI
supports the calling of arbitrary Java functions and stashing
their results in variables. There are two types of testing:
throw-away, one-shot tests and repeatable, automated tests. </p>

<p>Throw away tests. A CLI has these advantages over coding the
tests in Java:</p>

<ol>
    <li>As you futz with a test, you don't have to pay the
        recompile/relink cost.</li>
    <li>It's easier to try things out: simple things are easier
        to do.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, can such tests not be run with the debugger? (I don't
know.)</p>

<p>Repeatable tests. The CLI advantage is smaller here, because
the tests are more complicated and you're spending much less of
their lifetime futzing with them (and more documenting,
rerunning, configuration managing, etc.) In order to write
repeatable tests that are actually maintainable and maintained,
the CLI must be a full-featured programming language. In
particular, it needs the equivalent of include files or
libraries, full control flow, functions, etc. I have my doubts
the advantages <u>to white box testing alone</u> justify such a
full-featured language. (Note that I'm not ruling out some
combination of a CLI and external language like Perl, though that
seems less plausible than for the simple load testing above.)</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Non-testers. </b></font><u>This</u>
requirements document does not address the needs of people like
ordinary users wanting an adventure-style interface, people
writing bots, hub administrators writing administrative scripts.
Serving those people might well cause the CLI to be bigger.</p>

<h2><a name="functions">Functions</a></h2>

<p>Each requirement is named. <font color="#008000">Green</font>
names denotes requirements that must be met. Black means the
requirements may be met (are desirable, but not essential).
Requirements are also tagged with either &quot;MUST&quot; or
&quot;Should&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Actions.</u></font> Every action that
can be performed through the GUI can be performed through the
command line, <u>unless</u> those actions affect nothing but GUI
state. <font color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>All world object user-visible methods can be
                called through the GUI. </li>
            <li>This includes world objects normally controlled
                via their own popup window, such as the catalog,
                pocket, address book, and inventory. (98/06/30 -
                added address book because it's an important
                case)</li>
            <li>It also includes the watermark.</li>
            <li>It need not include anything that launches a
                browser.</li>
            <li>There is no need (and no desire) to control
                things like window placement. There is no desire
                to put up a particular menu on, say, an avatar.
                If a particular avatar operation (say) is
                selected, it matters not whether the menu
                corresponding to that operation appears on the
                screen.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>All of the features here present no problem.
Implementation of the external windows will have to include a
command syntax which allows selections to be made for the
individual elements which are defined within that page. This is a
good general approach to take with each window in any case since
it allows the writing and testing of the back-end without having
a window present. It should be noted that this is NOT a function
of the CLI but of the UI presenter interface for each specific UI
Presenter.</i></p>

<p><i>It should be noted with respect to verbs as commands.
These are not in the code. These are in a resource file which map
command ids to verb strings. If you want to use verb strings in
this you'll have to one...look at the resource file mappings or
query the object to see what the actual command string is. The
unum AND the CLI doesn't &quot;know&quot; them until runtime when
they are bound in. I will resist ANY attempt to change this! I
can add support for the command ids as a scripting nicety. [ctg
080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[ I assume that a test will be able to do something like </p>

<pre>

	pickup rock
	moveto door

</pre>

<p>It doesn't matter to me if &quot;pickup&quot; and
&quot;moveto&quot; are defined in the code or a resource file.
Either way, if a verb changes, we'd have to go and fix all the
tests that use it. So I hope verbs don't change. </p>

<p>There should be no more reason for a test to look up command
ids than for a user to do so. A test is just an automated user.
]]] </p>

<p><i>These are defined in the resource file and will change iff
someone edits the file to change them. They are only used by CLI
and should probably be renamed to reflect this. Internally they
are only used to &quot;find&quot; the correct responder to
forward the command to just as &quot;slots&quot; are used to find
the correct responder in the GUI. [ctg 090798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Mechanism</u></font><u>.</u> The
command to perform an action should not refer to what's visible
through the GUI. <font color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>No use of pixel coordinates if a name can be
                used. (Use of pixel coordinates when there is no
                other way to specify a location is fine.)</li>
            <li>No references to menus in commands.</li>
            <li>No need to refer to a list item by its position
                in the list.</li>
            <li>When referring to an object by its name, note
                that names may contain spaces.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>This would be almost impossible to do any other way. The
UI Framework is the only thing which will know about menus. I'm
removing the notion of slot from the view of the unum. You don't
have to specify anything except a verb or command-id.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Locations</u></font><u>.</u> There
must be a way to populate a room with objects that don't overlap
- are clearly separable visually. <font color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>I don't care if it's done by specifying absolute
                coordinates (though the 3D coordinates are pretty
                hard to use) or by some sort of
                collision-avoidance &quot;putat&quot;.</li>
            <li>But remember that some testers <u>may</u> want to
                use pixel-perfect coordinates anyway, for other
                purposes.</li>
            <li>If it's done by coordinates, it would be awfully
                nice to be able to find the coordinates of a
                point in the GUI in some way easier than putting
                an object there and then opening the property
                sheet to see where it is.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>I don't believe this has anything to do with a command
line interface. This is a function of defining a region NOT
issuing commands. If you want to in real time add and move things
around in a 3D coordinate space you'll need to do something on
the region end of things. I believe trying to get the &quot;no
overlap&quot; to happen other than programmatically won't work.
So item one is probably a non-starter. The command line interface
will accept 3d points as part of a command. Item 3, adding GUI
support will extend the GUI interface delivery by not less than a
week, possibly more.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[As long as there's a &quot;putat 3,5,6&quot;, that's OK. </p>

<p>Definitely not worth adding a week just to make a tester's
life easier. ]]] </p>

<p><i>Not a problem. There may be a better interface for placing
objects in a scene, if that happens then you should get the
feature there.[ctg 090798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Completion</u></font><u>.</u> All
operations should indicate completion. Completion of operation A
should not be signalled until any possible following operation B
that can depend on operation A could complete successfully. <font
color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>For example, the &quot;put down&quot; operation
                should not signal successful completion until a
                &quot;pick up&quot; operation on the same object
                can be started.</li>
            <li>If some operations, like bowing, can be followed
                at any point by any operation, it's acceptable to
                indicate completion as soon as the operation
                starts. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>These seem contradictory. Either we have a notion
        of &quot;next operation&quot; or not. Unfortunately it
        also seems highly subjective. I don't think this is a
        function of the CLI in any case. It is the responsibility
        of any unum to notify completion of a command with either
        success or failure and a reason for failure. Both the GUI
        and CLI require this (see the exception handling
        document) I've already talked to RobJ about the need to
        modify the way changes get notified back upwards.
        Unfortunately, ONLY the unum knows whether a task is
        &quot;complete&quot; or not. If we state that the unum
        must send a &quot;complete or fail&quot; before any other
        command is accepted we have completed destroyed
        asynchonous processing.</i></p>
        <p>[[[ The reason we need a next operation is because
        scripts look like this: </p>
        <pre>
	send command:  pickup rock
	expect response:  &quot;putat success&quot;
	send command:  putat table
</pre>
        <p>We must be able to delay the &quot;putat&quot; until
        the pickup finishes. Otherwise scripts will break all
        over the place. I don't think this breaks asynchronous
        processing because we don't care if the unum will accept
        a new command before a previous one completes. That's
        fine. We just need a way to avoid *sending* that new
        command. Or am I mistaken? </p>
        <p>The distinction between commands that must tell the
        truth about completion and commands that can pretend
        isn't subjective. It's based on whether any other command
        in a script would break if the previous command said it
        was finished before it really was. In the case of
        &quot;pickup&quot;, a following &quot;putat&quot; would
        break. In the case of bowing, no command that follows a
        bow could fail if issued before the bowing finished. </p>
        <p>This is just a way to add some leeway to the unum
        implementation, by saying &quot;getting completion
        exactly right isn't that important for some
        commands&quot;. Of course, it's possible that later
        changes - like a new command - might mean that bowing
        subsequently has to get completion right. In the grand
        scheme of things, I don't think that's that big a risk.
        ]]] </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>OK. I think I understand where you're putting the delay.
You want the script to wait until a response happens. That seems
quite reasonable. I guess I was worried of a kind deadlock
occuring as in the case you described below. If the unum won't
accept any commands until this one completes there would be no
way to use the GUI to pickup the rock, since you're no longer
accepting commands. At the &quot;scripting level&quot;, I remove
all objections. [ctg 090798]</i></p>

<p><u>Result distinctiveness.</u> Each command's result must be
distinct in this sense: suppose you have a command C. Some
substring of the result message is always present. That substring
is never present in any command K. (Should)</p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>The fewer user-friendly but parser-unfriendly
                messages, the better. For example, two messages
                &quot;there are five objects&quot; and
                &quot;there is one object&quot; makes it
                complicated because we can't just grep for
                &quot;there are&quot;.</li>
            <li>Computerish messages like: &quot;putat success:
                ...&quot; will make us smile.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>I think we'll need two result syntaxes. The first will
probably be extremely computerish...namely command_id,
message_id. where command_id is the &quot;verb string&quot; and
message_id is the &quot;message string&quot;. You'll have to
watch your constants but I don't think that's impossible. The
second message will be &quot;verb string&quot; + &quot;message
string&quot; where these are user-friendly. You can specify on
the commandline which kind of output you want. Terse or verbose.
[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[ I don't understand. Can you give examples of the two
syntaxes for something like &quot;pickup rock&quot;? ]]] </p>

<p><i>OK here are the possible return types. Keep in mind that
the verb is completely removed from the responder...it doesn't
know it or care. Also keep in mind that the GUI will need to
report success and failure and it also doesn't use the verb. I
could modify this but here are the possible return types.</i></p>

<p><i>The first is what the unum will actually return to the ui
framework</i></p>

<p align="left"><i><b>ID = ErrorCode or COMMAND:PUTAT =
ERROR:NOERR</b></i></p>

<p><i>This is what the ui framework will output in console mode
with terse setting</i></p>

<p><i><b>verb string: = terse message string or putat =
success or putat = access denied</b></i></p>

<p><i>This is what the ui framework will output in console mode
with verbose setting. It is also suitable for a user level error
dialog in the gui.</i></p>

<p><i><b>verb string = verbose message string or The
&lt;object name&gt; is now located in the region at
&lt;x,y,z&gt;. or You cannot put &lt;object name&gt; in the
region at &lt;x,y,z&gt;: access denied.</b></i><i>[ctg

<p><i></i>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Result destination.</u> Results can be logged either via
the trace system or via some other mechanism. (MAY)</p>

<ul>
    <li><ul>
            <li>We leave open the possibility that the CLI may be
                a user interface, and that the results the tests
                work with are also what a user using the product
                in &quot;console mode&quot; sees.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><i>Not a problem.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Failures.</u></font> Operation
completion messages should distinguish unambiguously between
success and failure. Any information presented through the GUI
about the cause of the failure should also be presented via the
CLI (not necessarily in exactly the same form). If, however, the
GUI indicates failure by doing nothing, the CLI should still
issue an explicit &quot;you failed&quot; message. <font
color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<p><i>Not a problem.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Lists.</u></font> Whenever a list is
printed, it should have a distinct terminator so that's easy to
collect all and only the list elements. <font color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<p><i>Not a problem.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>GUI.</u></font> When the console is
active, it must still be possible to issue commands through the
GUI, even if a script is running. There need be no special effort
to deal gracefully with cases where the GUI and script issue
commands simultaneously.<font color="#008000">(MUST - PENDING FINAL RESOLUTION)</font>
(98/06/30 - changed to MUST)</p>

<p><i>If by console you mean running the gui with a log window.
This is not a problem. If you mean running a script and running
the gui simultaneously and keeping the GUI responsivie....add at
least 1 week to each the CLI and the GUI deliverables or about
two extra week. Sorry but this isn't even remotely
&quot;free&quot;.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[ Ouch. What does &quot;responsive&quot; mean? This
requirement is mainly used to do things like free stuck scripts.
For example, the script might get out of synch and not
&quot;realize&quot; that the rock is still in the avatar's hand,
so you use the GUI to point at the floor and select the
&quot;put&quot; menu item. It's OK if response isn't snappy (a
couple of seconds). Is that possible without a week? </p>

<p>The other part of this is that it's useful to watch what's
happening on the GUI as the script is running. Is that also
expensive? </p>

<p>To clarify: We're not looking for any addition to existing
behavior. Have you seen the existing scripts? Might help. Paul
should be able to show you. ]]] </p>

<p><i>OK. Let's clear this up. The GUI is also a console. The
console is NOT a GUI. Put another way there is only one ui
framework bound to a process at a time. The GUI supports console
commands through its log (console) window. To bind two frameworks
is problematic. The extra work on the GUI comes in because there
is currently no way to launch the GUI through a script and then
continue processing commands through that script. That will have
to be added to the GUI startup. I suspect there will be some
problems which are related to how things get loaded (meaning what
thread etc.) I'm assuming it will take a week to fix all of the
problems related to this. Now launching the gui and then using
its command line to startup a script is fairly straight forward.
There are still going to be coordination issues. Generally, a
process is either batch or interactive, we're going to have to
make sure we are able to do both simulataneously. That means
keeping the threading and event processing happy. I'm assuming
two weeks between the GUI, CLI and whatever external script
processor we use to keep everybody happy and deadlock free.[ctg

<p>
[[[bem 100798:
<pre>
I'm not clear enough on the implementation to follow that.  Let me
give some specific scenarios of how I am almost certain testers will
use a text interface to Neocosm to build tests.  I'll talk about both
E (internal scripting language) and Perl (an external one).  Perhaps
this will force us to decide between the two.

First, suppose we're using E.

1. I'm creating a test.
   - I start Neocosm with an avatar and open the log window.
   - I type various commands in the log window, putting the
     avatar through its paces once, seeing if what I plan to do
     with the script makes sense.
   - In my trusty editor, I create a script file, "foobar.e".
   - In the log window, I run the script with "#include foobar.e"
     or whatever.
        - I need to watch the graphical image of the avatar as
          it follows the script.  Not being able to do that will
          make tests significantly harder to write and probably lead
          to missed bugs.
        - I don't care if I can't type in the log window until
          the script finishes.
        - I'd like it if the mouse and keyboard are active during
          the script.  So, for example, if I forgot to have the
          avatar put down the table and the script is hung, I can
          make the avatar put down the table.  HOWEVER, I can
          live without this.

2. I'm running that test.
   - I need to start Neocosm from the command line in some way
     that says "start, using this avatar, and running this script".
     Basically, as soon as the avatar appears in the starting region,
     it starts to run the script.  This is necessary for a nightly
     build smoke test.
   - I also need a way to log results from the test.  That could be
     by spilling the log window's contents to disk, having E manage
     its own file for results, or having E write to standard output.

(In r167, you also need to use the GUI sometimes in finished tests.
But that's because some commands are available only from the GUI and
some commands report success too soon.  I hope we won't need to do
that in Neocosm.)

Now, suppose we're using Perl.  The essential difference here is that
Perl drives Neocosm through standard input and waits for expected
results by scanning standard output.  So, to be explicit, here's the
testing process with Perl.  Steps the same as above are tagged with
"@" instead of "-".

1. I'm creating a test.
   @ I start Neocosm with an avatar and open the log window.
   @ I type various commands in the log window, putting the
     avatar through its paces once, seeing if what I plan to do
     with the script makes sense.
   @ In my trusty editor, I create a script file, "foobar.pl".
   - I run the perl script.  It execs Neocosm, wires up standard
     input and output, stuffs commands into standard input and
     reads standard output.
        @ I need to watch the graphical image of the avatar as
          it follows the script.  Not being able to do that will
          make tests significantly harder to write and probably lead
          to missed bugs.
        - The log window is irrelevant.
        @ I'd like it if the mouse and keyboard are active during
          the script.  So, for example, if I forgot to have the
          avatar put down the table and the script is hung, I can
          make the avatar put down the table.  HOWEVER, I can
          live without this. (But note that people coding up bots
          probably can't.)

2. I'm running that test.
   @ I need to start Neocosm from the command line in some way
     that says "start, using this avatar, and running this script".
     Basically, as soon as the avatar appears in the starting region,
     it starts to run the script.  This is necessary for a nightly
     build smoke test.
   - Results are logged by Perl, which prints failure messages to
     standard output or a file.

So:  what of the above can be supported without the two weeks of work?

last year, where there was no one place where you could find all

updated would be OK. So would per-unum files, as long as there
was a simple way to find the right file. </p>

<p><i>The menus.text file will tell you all the commands and
there verb matching. The commands that an object can recieve at
any one point and time is always changing. I would use the
menus.text file to keep abreast of the new commands as they come
into being. There is probably an eay way to turn this into
javadoc. As I've already mentioned, verbs are largely a CLI
command set the GUI eqivalent to menu items. If you need to know
what an object can handle at a specific moment when you're
running, you can either issue a help command to that object or
use the return messages and what they imply to determine if a
command is now available. [ctg 090798]</i></p>

<p><u>Name ambiguity.</u> If two different objects have the same
name, it would be nice - but not essential - that there be a way
to distinguish between them (&quot;Table (1)&quot; and
&quot;Table (2)&quot;). If there's no way to disambiguate
objects, it would be better for the CLI to fail than to just pick
one of the synonymous objects. (Should)</p>

<p><i>Name ambiguity has been fixed in the redesign of the
console. Every object will be given a unique name for the time it
remains within a region. If you move to a different region you
are not guarenteed that the name of conflicting objects will be
the same. In most cases this is not a problem, since only objects
not people are likely to have a conflict. If an avatar carries an
object from one region to the next you can query the avatar to
find out what the name is of the currently held object. You will
also be able to tell the &quot;name&quot; of an object by mousing
over it in the GUI if you set the appropriate variable.[ctg
080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[ OK by me. I suspect that our workaround to the
changing-name problem will be for each script to use only one of
each type of object and to have a setup step in which those
objects are given a name unique to this script (by changing the
name in the catalog before creating them, for example). The
latter will be useful because it will allow us to run multiple
scripts at the same time, which is what load testing is all
about.]]] </p>

                have a &quot;contents&quot; query and an
                &quot;appearance&quot; query that gives its

            <li>It is essential that we be able to do this before

                remote host before the transition completes. This
                type of testing will be less important than in

                likely implementation is a non-blocking version
                of all commands and a generic &quot;wait until X
                happens&quot; command, but we don't much care.

<p><i>I don't think this is really a CLI problem. It's unclear
to me _HOW_ you're going to kill a connection to an object which
is &quot;no where&quot;. I don't think you will suceed in all
cases. Something somewhere needs to have hold of it. On a region
transition the UI must &quot;let go&quot; anything it's holding
on to or risk memory failures. I don't know how you'll find the
object. Either way, it sound like you need an UNUM level command
which allows una to kill all connections or kill some
connections. All the CLI can do is hand off the command. All of
the above, especially the &quot;wait until x&quot; seem to be
inviting dead-locks and memory problems. I don't know how this is
going to implemented but I would allow at least two plus weeks to
get this close to right.[ctg 080798]</i></p>

<p>[[[ Yes, I expect most of this is done outside the CLI. But
the totality of the system needs to support it. </p>

<p>Example: Bill will have a DataComm interface that allows you
to kill a connection. We need higher-level objects to invoke that
interface, all the way up to an unum object. So,
programmatically, you could take an unum and call a &quot;kill
this unum's connection&quot; method. All the CLI has to do is
pass the command onto the unum. </p>

<p>I also don't think the &quot;kill the connection to a region
before you get to that region&quot; issue is a CLI issue. I don't
know the plumbing well enough to know if it's possible or how
it's possible, but I'm envisioning something like </p>

<pre>
	ref = portal.getRef();
	while (! ref.hasConnection) ; // spin
        ref.killConnection();
</pre>

<p>This is the first requirement that implies a built-in
scripting language like E. I should separate out this particular
bullet point - it's not a MUST. We should do it only if it's
fairly tractable (less than a week total for everyone involved?).
I mention it because it would be nice it this ability weren't
precluded. It targets what's historically been a
failure-sensitive area. </p>

<p>The last bullet - &quot;wait until X&quot; - is badly
expressed. This will be done on top of the CLI, either in Perl or
E or whatever. All I mean is that we'll have a test support
library somewhere that contains definitions like this: </p>

<pre>
void putat (x) {
  sendCommand(&quot;putat &quot; + x);
  expect(&quot;putat succeeded&quot;);
}

void putat_nonblocking (x) {
  sendCommand(&quot;putat &quot; + x);
}

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Noninterleaving.</u></font> It is OK
for text to appear asynchronously in the CLI. For example,
&quot;Fred is now on-line&quot; messages due to the address book,
as well as word balloons. However, these messages should never
appear in the middle of another message. It would be bad if
&quot;Fred is no on-line&quot; appears in the middle of a listing
of the region's contents. <font color="#008000">(MUST)</font></p>

<p><i>Not a problem</i></p>

<p><font color="#008000"><u>Echoing.</u></font>
If results of script commands go to standard output, you
must be able to echo commands there too (so that you can tell what
caused a particular result).  This would be off by default.  (This
has historically been very useful in Perl scripts.)
