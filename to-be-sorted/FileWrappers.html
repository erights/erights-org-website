<H1>File Wrappers </H1>

<P>
<B>Last updated:</B> [98/05/14 Chip]
<P> <I>This page was written by <I>Chip,</I> based on <I>Arturo's</I> excellent 
  <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/neocosm/SubsystemDocTemplate.html"><I>template.</I></A>

<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>
The file wrapper subsystem provides an alternative API for Java
file I/O. It provides essentially the same functionality as the
standard <FONT FACE="Courier">java.io</FONT> classes (if fact,
it is built on top of them), but does so in a way that is capability
secure and Vat-safe. The idea is to treat file and directory accessors
as the objects from which file access is derived, rather than
allowing file name strings to designate access.<BR>

<H2>Requirements </H2>

<P>
The principal requirement of the file wrapper subsystem was to
provide a Vat-safe means for objects running in the Vat to access
files. The standard Java file access classes are not suitable
because they grant access via static methods and variables (thus
preventing control over which objects can access what) and because
they cannot be made to behave appropriately in a quake (either
by surviving or by letting themselves be cleanly smashed).<BR>

<H2>Architecture </H2>

<P>
The <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.e.file package</FONT> provides capability-secure
file access to guest objects in the Vat. This overview describes
the basic architecture of the package: what the classes are and
how they relate to each other. For the specific details of the
interfaces of these classes, consult the appropriate javadoc pages.
<P>
Files and directories are represented as objects. There is a set
of objects for files and a set of objects for directories. Within
each set, different classes of object encapsulate different sorts
of access to the files or directories which their instances describe.
<P>
There are three varieties of directory object:
<P>
<B>EReadableDirectory</B> - read-only access to contained files
and directories
<P>
<B>EAccessibleDirectory</B> - read-only access to contained directories,
edit access to contained files
<P>
<B>EEditableDirectory</B> - edit access to contained files and
directories
<P>
And three varieties of file object:
<P>
<B>EReadableFile</B> - read-only access to a file, optionally
random access
<P>
<B>EAppendableFile</B> - append-only write access to a file
<P>
<B>EEditableFile</B> - read/write access to a file, optionally
random access
<P>
All of the objects of classes <B>EXxxxDirectory</B> or <B>EXxxxFile</B>
are instances of <B>EDirectoryEntry</B> and support a common interface
that allows you to determine if the described entity in fact exists,
find out if it is a file or directory, and find out if it is contained
by a particular directory.
<P>
All the <B>EXxxxDirectory</B> objects can provide a list of their
contents, in the form of a <B>ReadOnlyHashtable</B> which maps
from <B>Strings</B> to <B>EDirectoryEntry</B> objects (<FONT FACE="Courier">org.erights.e.elib.util.ReadOnlyHashtable</FONT>
works like a regular Java hashtable, except that you can't modify
it).
<P>
From an <B>EReadableDirectory</B> object you can obtain <B>EReadableDirectory</B>
and <B>EReadableFile</B> objects for the directories and files
within that directory.
<P>
From an <B>EAccessibleDirectory</B> object you can obtain <B>EAccessibleDirectory</B>
and <B>EEditableFile</B> objects for the directories and files
within that directory. In addition, from an <B>EAccessibleDirectory</B>
object you can obtain an <B>EReadableDirectory</B> object for
the same directory.
<P>
From an <B>EEditableDirectory</B> object you can obtain <B>EEditableDirectory</B>
and <B>EEditableFile</B> objects for the directories and files
within that directory. In addition, from an <B>EEditableDirectory</B>
object you can obtain an <B>EReadableDirectory</B> or <B>EAccessibleDirectory</B>
object for the same directory. Furthermore, an <B>EEditableDirectory</B>
object allows you to modify the directory it represents by adding,
deleting, renaming and relocating the files and directories within
it.
<P>
From an <B>EReadableFile</B> or an <B>EEditable</B> file object
you can obtain an input stream for sequential read access or an
<B>EFileReader</B> object for random access reading of the corresponding
file.
<P>
From an <B>EEditableFile</B> object or an <B>EAppendableFile</B>
object you can obtain an output stream for sequential write access
(to the end of) the corresponding file.
<P>
From an <B>EEditableFile</B> object you can obtain an <B>EFileEditor</B>
object for random access reading and writing of the corresponding
file. In addition, from an <B>EEditableFile</B> object you can
obtain an <B>EReadableFile</B> or <B>EAppendableFile</B> object
for the same file.
<P>
Note that the file and directory access provided by the above
described objects are circular in nature: the only way to get
a file or directory object is from another file or directory object.
This raises the question of how you get a file or directory object
to begin with. The answer is that there is an <B>EDirectoryRootMaker</B>
object (of which only one instance exists) which has the power
to produce an <B>EEditableDirectory</B> object given only a string
representing the pathname of the directory in question. The <B>EDirectoryRootMaker</B>
object is generated at startup time and should be closely held.
<P>
The <B>EFileReader</B> and <B>EFileEditor</B> objects, as well
as the input and output stream objects obtainable from <B>EXxxxFile</B>
objects, are fragile. That is, they get smashed in a quake. Attempts
to perform I/O after a quake will result in a <B>SmashedException</B>
(which is a type of <B>IOExcpetion</B>). However, the <B>EXxxxDirectory</B>
and <B>EXxxxFile</B> objects are sturdy. They survive a quake
just fine, though do not guarantee that the state of the file
system will be the same after the quake as before (they will,
however, always present a correct view of the <I>current</I> state
of the file system).
<P>
The input and output streams provided by the file classes are
implemented by <B>EInputStream</B> and <B>EOutputStream</B>, which
are streams that behave appropriately (i.e., the get smashed)
in a quake. There is also an alternative version of <B>EOutputStream</B>
called <B>QuakeProofAppendFile</B> whose behavior on return from
a quake is to seek to the end of the file and resume writing.
<P>
The <B>EStdio</B> class provides access in the Vat to the standard
I/O streams that the class <B>System</B> provides outside the
Vat. The methods <B>EStdio.out()</B>, <B>EStdio.in()</B> and <B>EStdio.err()</B>
correspond to the same input or output streams as <B>System.out</B>,
<B>System.in</B> and <B>System.err</B>, respectively. The difference
is that the streams provided by <B>EStdio</B> are sturdy whereas
those provided by <B>System</B> are not. And yes, these <I>are</I>
static methods; talk to MarkM or me about why we decided that
these were OK even though they break one of the cardinal rules.
<H4>Off the shelf alternatives </H4>

<P>
The obvious alternative to using this package is simply to use
the regular Java I/O classes, if Vat safety and/or capability
security are not concerns.<BR>

<H2>Current implementation </H2>

<H4>Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover? 
</H4>

<P>
All the classes in this subsystem are in the package <FONT FACE="Courier">ec.e.file</FONT>,
which are in the single directory <FONT FACE="Courier">ec4/javasrc/ec/e/file</FONT>.
<H4>Is it JavaDoc'ed? </H4>

<P>
The file wrapper package is completely JavaDoc'd, except for a
mysterious class of unknown provenenance called <B>URLStreamMaker</B>.
<H4>Testing and Debugging </H4>

<P>
In the older ec3 tree, in <FONT FACE="Courier">ec3/E/runtime/e/file</FONT>,
are a couple of test programs, <FONT FACE="Courier">FileTest.e</FONT>
and <FONT FACE="Courier">QuakeFileTest.e</FONT>. These have not
been converted for ec4 or later environments. The file wrapper
package itself is fairly small and simple and has not required
much further maintenance since it was first released. Thes test
programs were fairly ad hoc and informal; they are probably not
worth converting.<BR>

<H2>Design Issues</H2>

<H4>Open Issues </H4>

<P>
The future need for this package is debatable. In a future product
which allows user-submitted Java code to run in our environment,
the capability-secure aspects of this file access paradigm will
be essential. However, the Vat-safety aspects are less critical
now that we have switched to state-bundle persistence rather than
orthogonal persistence. The paradigm is also somewhat awkward
to use for programmers used to simply naming a file with a string.
And there is a further question as to whether user-submitted Java
code should be accessing files at all. On the other hand, the
implementation has proven reasonably reliable and trouble free
and we have a fair quantity of code in our source base which depends
on it. Maintaining a capability-safe source base is probably a
wise thing to do, all other cost factors being equal.
