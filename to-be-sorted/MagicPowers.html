<H1>Magic Powers in The New World Order</H1>

Magic powers were a capability-compatible way to bootstrap access
to external services, such as file I/O. If a service can be defined
in advance, the means of initializing it and encapsulating it
in objects (that is capabilities) can be handled by the TCB directly.
However, we were also confronted with services which didn't really
belong inside the core runtime but which nevertheless needed to
be bootstrapped into the capability world. These services may
be part of what we think of as the application rather than the
runtime infrastructure, but they are still part of the TCB.
<P>
The Java way to add such services is by attaching them to static
methods, allowing class names to be used as globals which anybody
can access. The problem with this is that anybody can access them;
it is very much not the capability idea at all (this is, in fact,
the fundamental problem with Java as a capability language - which
we have thus far devised 3 or 4 different ways to fix!).
<P>
So what we did was treat the right to dereference a class name
as itself a closely held capability. This power was vested in
the EEnvironment object. Unfortunately, about all you can do with
a class name in such a case is instantiate an instance of the
class. So that's what EEnvironment did: the magicPower() method
accepted a class name and created an instance of that class. The
newly instantiated object was expected to implement the MagicPowerMaker
interface, so that its make() method could be called, resulting
(one hoped) in a new object which was the magic power itself.
This worked -- it is a general mechanism for creating special-case
capabilities.
<P>
To create a new magic power, you would create a TCB class which
implemented MagicPowerMaker and give it whatever power it needed
to instantiate an instance of the special capability itself (typically
by being inside a package boundary and accessing package-scoped
constructors). For example, the capability-oriented file package
was bootstrapped via the class EDirectoryRootMakerMaker, whose
make() method returned an instance of EDirectoryRootMaker which
was in turn the magic power from which file access flowed. Typically,
the magic power class itself would have a static summon() method
which encapsulated this, so that you didn't have to know the MagicPowerMaker
class directly (even though it uses a static method, the summon()
pattern is safe because you need to pass an EEnvironment object
as a parameter, which you can only get in the first place if you
are already inside the trust boundary).
<P>
The other piece of the magic power story was that the EEnvironment
would keep a hashtable of the magic powers that had been created
(indexed by the MagicPowerMaker class name). So the EEnvironment
was also responsible for maintaining this special bag of root
level powers. This means that you could always get a power from
the EEnvironment but the EEnvironment class itself didn't need
to have any special knowledge about which powers exist (resulting,
in theory at least, in a better extensibility story).
<P>
Oh, and there were some other complications, like the ComparingMagicPower
interface, which you don't even want to know about, trust me.
<P>
As we move into the New World Order Simplicity And Goodness, there
are three main problems with the magic power approach:
<OL>
<LI>It has a lot of mechanism (bloat)
<LI>It's hard for people to understand (resulting in error and
amazing cruft)
<LI>It's awkward and hard to use (resulting in error and in avoidance
behavior)
</OL>

<P>
I also have an aesthetic objection, as the self-appointed Reichschancellor
of Code Hygiene, to what I call the &quot;Big Bag Of Shit&quot;
model -- &quot;We don't know how to structure this stuff, so let's
just dump it all in this BBOS.&quot; Whenever I see a BBOS you
should just know that I'm going to try to get rid of it. That
hashtable in EEnvironment is a BBOS (hashtables are a traditional
BBOS data structure).
<P>
So here's the new model for magic powers, which I have incorporated
with great happiness into the current Boot system:
<P>
Magic power classes produce their magic power object via their
constructor (that is, they <I>are</I> the magic power object).
The class keeps a private static boolean flag that prevents more
than one instance of the class from being instantiated. Code in
the TCB makes sure it calls this constructor before any non-TCB
code gets invoked. Once the magic power is initialized, it's a
capability.
<P>
Realistically, even though we wanted the collection of magic powers
to be arbitrarily extensible, the reality is that there is a basic,
fixed set which really matters. So the EEnvironment knows about
a fixed collection of magic powers which are cr
