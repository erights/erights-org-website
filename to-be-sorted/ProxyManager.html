Proxy Management in Neocosm</H1>
<B>Last updated:</B><I> [98/07/19 Bob]</I> Author: Bob Schumaker. 
<H2>
Introduction</H2>
The Proxy Manager is the layer between raw communications and remote object references. High-level distributed object will never access data communication primitives directly. Instead, the higher layers will access remote objects through a proxy mechanism.
<H2>
Requirements</H2>

<OL>
  <LI> Encapsulate secure and authenticated remote object references in a 'simple' 
    interface (currently <TT><A HREF="../javadoc/org/erights/e/elib/ref/Ref.html">Ref</A></TT>)</LI>
<LI>
Hide the details of the low-level communications mechanisms from the distributed object layer</LI>
<LI>
Provide consistent failure semantics for all proxies that travel over a single physical connection (<I>i.e.</I> if the underlying transport fails in a way that will affect all traffic over that connection, make sure that all clients of that connection also fail)</LI>

</OL>

<H2>
Architecture</H2>
<H4>
Current Architecture Overview</H4>
In the current system, proxy objects are closely tied to the underlying connection in that the fragile references to objects go through a per-connection table (import/export).
<H4>
Proposed Architecture Overview</H4>
How proxies get created, an overview (straw man until some of the actual details can be hammered out, success is assumed everywhere):
<OL>
<LI><TT>FollowRef</TT> is invoked on a SturdyRef object (&lt;registrar
ID&gt;, &lt;object id&gt;) [&lt;object ID&gt; is a swiss number]</LI> <LI>A proxy
constructor is invoked (Proxy(&lt;registrar ID&gt;, &lt;object ID&gt;)<LI> <LI>The
proxy code asks the low-level comm system for a connection object</LI>
<LI>A connection is opened and returned (or a reference to an already
open connection)</LI> <LI>The proxy code asks the connection for a
reference to &lt;object id&gt;, specifying its local reference (this is
optional really, since all messages could be addressed purely by swiss
number -- but we're assuming a table structure along the lines of the
current import/export table)</LI> <LI>The comm system makes the
request of the remote machine</LI> <LI>The remote machine's comm
system checks to see if &lt;object id&gt; is exported to the requesting
machine</LI> <LI>The remote machine fills in its derived table and
returns success to the requestor</LI> <LI>The local machine's comm
system returns the appropriate data-comm level reference for the
remote object (a table index, perhaps?)</LI> <LI>The proxy constructor
finishes, and the proxy is now ready to accept 'E.Send' requests</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
Which directories on our tree does this subsystem cover?</H4>
This subsystem is contained in the package org.erights.e.net.proxy.
<H4>
Is it JavaDoc'ed?</H4>
The JavaDoc for the proxy subsystem can be found in <A HREF="../javadoc/net/captp/jcomm/package-summary.html">the 
package summary</A>. 
<H4>
Examples</H4>
<I>Are there examples?</I>
<H4>
Testing and Debugging</H4>
<I>(Optional) Lists any tests and debugging utilities which are to be developed
to help test the design (e.g. test classes, trace categories, etc.)</I>
<H2>
Design Issues</H2>

<H4>
Resolved Issues</H4>
<I>History of issues raised and resolved during initial design, or during
design inspections. Can also include alternative designs, with the reasons
why they were rejected</I>
<H4>
Open Issues</H4>
