<H1>Timer Support </H1>

<P> <B>Last updated:</B> [98/06/18 Chip] <I>This page was written by <I>Chip,</I> 
  based on <I>Arturo's</I> excellent <A HREF="http://www-int.communities.com/engineering/neocosm/SubsystemDocTemplate.html"><I>template.</I></A>

<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P> In lieu of attempting to deconstruct the old timer API, this document describes 
  the new timer API. 
<H2>Overview </H2>

<P>
There are five public classes/interfaces in the new timer API
(which will live in the package org.erights.e.extern.timer):
<UL>
<LI>Timer -- Control object for timer-related stuff
<LI>Timeout -- Object representing a one-time timeout event
<LI>TimeoutHandling -- Interface to be implemented by objects interested
in being informed of timeout events
<LI>Clock -- Object representing a stream of clock tick events
<LI>TickHandling -- Interface to be implemented by objects interested
in being informed of clock tick events
</UL>
As of now there is a single, statically allocated Timer object.
Everything else, however, is accessed via object references so
going to a full-up capability model is trivial.
<P>
There are two kinds of timer-related things which Timer provides,
timeouts and clocks. A timeout is a one-time event whereas a clock
repeats. Timer provides the methods setTimeout() and newClock()
(respectively) for setting up these two kinds of things. In either
case you indicate the time duration, an object to handle the event
when it happens, and a flag indicating whether synchronous (i.e.,
direct Java method call) or asynchronous (i.e., posting a message
on the E run queue) is to be used for notification. You can also
provide an arbitrary object of your own choosing which will be
held and passed on along with the even notification.
<P>
The setTimeout() method returns a Timeout object which can be
used to cancel the timeout and also serves to identify the timeout
event when it happens.
<P>
The newClock() method returns a Clock object which can be used
to start, stop and otherwise fiddle with the clock and which also
serves to identify clock tick events when they happen.
<P> Where things work the same as they did before, I tried to retain the basic 
  feature functionality and class/method naming of the existing timer and clock 
  machinery, so as to be minimally disruptive. Clock, in particular, still has 
  too many features for my taste, but it should be fine for now.
