<H2><A NAME="SeeChanges"></A>How can I see what files I have changed?</H2>

<P>Use the command <TT>cvs -nq update -d</TT>. This is like a normal update
but the <TT>-n</TT> flag means it doesn't actually do anything. It just
tells you quick status about all files in the directory and its subdirectories.
Output is a list of filenames preceded by one of: </P>

<DL>
<DT>?</DT>

<DD>This is a file that is not in the cvs repository but is in your local
tree. Look carefully at these files. A lot of them will be junk (log files
etc.), but some may be files you've forgotten to <TT>cvs add</TT>. </DD>

<DT>M</DT>

<DD>This is a file that you've modified but haven't committed yet </DD>

<DT>A</DT>

<DD>This is a file that you've added but haven't committed yet </DD>

<DT>R</DT>

<DD>This is a file that you've removed but haven't committed yet </DD>

<DT>U</DT>

<DD>This is a file thats changed in the repository, and you don't have
the latest version. You'll need to get it before you commit. </DD>

<DT>P</DT>

<DD>(Windows only) This is a file thats changed in the repository, and
you don't have the latest version. Not sure why this is different from
U. </DD>

<DT>C</DT>

<DD>This is a file that's changed in the repository <I>and</I> changed
(differently) in your tree. You'll have to merge the two sets of changes
before checking in </DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="MissingDir"></A>Cvs can't open my directory; what's wrong?</H2>

<P>If you do a <TT>cvs update</TT> and then get a message of the form <TT>cvs
[update aborted]: cannot open directory /home/cvsroot/src/somethingorother:
No such file or directory</TT>, then someone has deleted a directory. Your
local copy of the directory tree still contains references to the (now
missing) directory so cvs complains that it can't update it. The fix is
to manually edit the cvs Entries file in your tree containing the missing
directory. So, in our example, you'd edit <TT>src/CVS/Entries</TT> (note
that we stripped off the initial <TT>/home/cvsroot/</TT> and the final
part of the pathname, then added <TT>CVS/Entries</TT>). This should contain
a line of the form: <TT>D/somethingorother////</TT>. Delete this line and
try your update again. </P>

<H2><A NAME="WontUpdate"></A>I've updated but I don't get the latest files;
what's wrong?</H2>

<P>There are two common causes for this: </P>

<UL>
<LI>You forgot to use the <TT>-d</TT> flag. Unless you use this flag, cvs
will not copy over any newly added directories. Most people <I>always</I>
use <TT>-d</TT> to avoid just this problem. In fact it's probably worth
setting up an alias which does <TT>cvs -q update -d</TT> (the <TT>-q</TT>
cuts down on the spam cvs gives you). The only disadvantage of routinely
using <TT>-d</TT> is that you may hit the missing directory bug (see <A HREF="#MissingDir">Cvs
can't open my directory; what's wrong?</A>). This bug doesn't show up if
you don't use <TT>-d</TT>. </LI>

<LI>You may have a sticky bit set. If you check out a file using an explicit
version number e.g. you do <TT>cvs update -r1.2 <I>somefile</I></TT> then
cvs marks <I>somefile</I> with a &quot;sticky bit&quot;. Subsequent updates
will <I>not</I> update that file. To force an update you can use the <TT>-A</TT>
flag to cvs. On Unix this behaves as you'd hope - updates any files that
are out of date for any reason, including sticky bits. On Windows, unfortunately,
it updates <I>everything</I>, up to date or not. So you should probably
do <TT>cvs update -A <I>somefile</I></TT> to update just the file you really
want to update. </LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Rename"></A>How do I rename a file in cvs?</H2>

<P>Hah! You don't. That would be too easy. You have to rename the file,
then <TT>cvs remove</TT> the old name, then <TT>cvs add</TT> the new one.
This is a royal pain in the butt, and screws up the version history by
splitting it into two parts - before and after the rename. You should probably
put the old name of the file in the checkin message for the <TT>cvs add</TT>,
so people looking at the log of the new file will know how to get at the
log of its previous incarnation. </P>

<P>There is a way to rename files that avoids these problem but it's horribly 
  arcane. Here's a link to the appropriate part of the <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/cgi-bin/molli/wilma.cgi/doc.847210383.html">CVS 
  reference manual</A> if you really want to try it. </P>

<H2><A NAME="DeleteDir"></A>How do I delete a directory in cvs?</H2>

<P>Removing directories while maintaining change history works just fine.
</P>

<P>Here is how you do it: </P>

<PRE>cd the_dir_you_want_to_remove
rm *
cvs remove
commit -m &quot;they're all gone&quot;
</PRE>

<P>If someone does a 'cvs update' at this point, they get an empty directory.
This is apparently what's been bothering people, so they go into $CVSROOT
and remove the directory from there. DON'T EVER remove a directory from
$CVSROOT!!!! That looses change information for the files that were in
there. If someone tried to recreate the state of the system as it was before
the directory was removed, they couldn't do it. </P>


<H2><A NAME="makebranch"></A>How do I branch a tree?</H2>

<P>Branching a tree in CVS is a tricky tagging process.
</P>

<P>From the tree to be branched, identify the tag from which to create a branch.
Also determine the branch tag.
</P>

<P>Type:
</P>

<PRE>
	cvs tag -b -r MyCurrentTag MyNewBranchTag <trees>
</PRE>

<P>If, for example, MyCurrentTag has version 2.3 then MyNewBranchTag 
will have version 2.3.0.2
</P>

<P> Note that is is possible to use rtag instead of tag. The difference
is that rtag works directly on the repository, i.e., no checkoout is required,
whereas tag bases the revision numbers on the working directory. It is also 
important to keep in mind that when working with a branch, files
committed over the branch are the only ones kept under the branch, all other
files remain under the main revision path. In other words, if we branch, to say,
the src tree, commit a file under the branch and then tag the tree, all files
will have main revision path nubers whereas the file committed will have branch
revision number. All files will share the same tag, nonetheless.
</P>


<H2><A NAME="EmptyDir"></A>I'm getting empty directories when I update;
what's up?</H2>

<P>You're probably updating a directory that has been deleted. To get cvs
to ignore empty directories, use the -P option to cvs update or cvs checkout.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="RenameDir"></A>How do I rename a directory in cvs?</H2>

<P>I'm not even going to try to answer this one. Look at the section in the section 
  in the <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/cgi-bin/molli/wilma.cgi/doc.847210383.html">CVS 
  reference manual</A> which explains the grim and gory details. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Lock"></A>I'm getting &quot;waiting for lock&quot; messages
when I try to use cvs; what's up?</H2>

<P>The kind of error message you may get is: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>waiting for uid51's lock in /home/cvsroot/www-int/engineering/design_notes
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>They usually happen when you're trying to update the master tree i.e.
you're doing a &quot;commit&quot;. When cvs changes the master tree it
creates lock files which block out other changes until the tree is consistent.
A simultaneous cvs update will spot the log files and block, printing out
message like the one above every 30 seconds. So often these messages are
just cvs doing its job - if you wait a while the other user's update will
finish, the lock files will be deleted, and your operation will continue.
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, sometimes cvs is killed (or crashes) halfway through
an operation, leaving the lock files lying around. In this case your operation
will never start, because the lock files never go away. So if you continue
to get lock messages, even after waiting for half an hour or so, you may
have hit some stale lock files. By the way, remember that some people use
cvs over a slow modem so the tree may legitimately be locked for a long
time, even if everything is working properly. </P>

<P>If you think you have hit stale lock files, first contact the user who's
id appears in the error message (in our example message the user id is
very unhelpful - uid51, probably an automatic script - but it will usually
be someone's Unix login id). If they say they aren't using cvs at the moment
then it's a good sign that the lock files are stale. You'll have to go
into the directory mentioned in the message (e.g. <TT>/home/cvsroot/www-int/engineering/design_notes</TT>
in our example) and delete the lock files manually. The lock files usually
start with <TT>#cvs.tfl</TT>, <TT>#cvs.rfl</TT>, or <TT>#cvs.wfl</TT>.
